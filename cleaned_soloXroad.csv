solotravel,"Hi everyone, I am planning a solo trip for this summer to Boston, MA. I chose this spot based on its day trip potential, as there are a few cities within an hour that are all worth visiting. The ones I am planning to visit are:

- Boston, MA
- Salem, MA
- Cape cod / Plymouth 
- Providence, RI
- Portland, ME

My question is, is 6 days enough time to visit all of these cities? Would 1 day for each location be enough? Also, how is public transportation in this area? Will I be able to get around without renting a car? I’m also considering taking the ferry from Boston to Provincetown, but not sure if it’s worth it or if i’ll have enough time. Any advice/recommendations would be super appreciated. Also if anyone also has recommendations for activities to do in these cities I would also highly appreciate.

**Portland/Mt. Hood/Oregon Coast area:** 4-5 days, Cape Falcon/Crescent Beach, Columbia River Gorge drive/waterfalls, Tamanawas Falls, Elk Meadows (stop in Astoria on way up into WA)

**Olympic NP**: 5-7 days, Enchanted Valley backpacking, Ruby Beach, Hurricane Ridge Trail, Hall of Mosses/Hoh Rainforest, Forks/La Push beaches

solotravel,"I’m 25 years old and basically I’m committed to quitting my job after COVID is over and traveling around the world for at least a couple of years before buying a house/settling down officially.

solotravel,"Hi,

This may sound like the dumbest and most insecure question, and I am really not even sure how to put it, but I stumbled on this subreddit a few months ago and mostly just reading through stories here, and the whole concept just sounds great to me, since I want to travel more but I can never tag my friends to come along, so I just give up each time.

I am 24M and I've never been out of my country because of that, so this thing concept is the key for me, but all the time when new people here ask for tips they often being told to first go out alone and only then try to plan a big trip.

But my question is, how do you start? where do you go? I realized that I am not a very independent person and I want to change it. I never go out alone, only with friends. The most I sometimes do alone is launch when I am at work, and even then it feels kinda awkward, so I just browse reddit on my phone, eat quickly and head back.

So can you give me some tips and places to go to help get me started? and please be as specific as you can about where to go, and some tips to what you try to do can also help (as most of my going out with friends is about chatting with them, so what to focus on instead when in the same places but solo)","This may sound stupid - but a tip I see all the time is ""go out solo and get used to it before trying to solo travel"", my question is how you get started?","Hi,

solotravel,"I’m forming a plan for a future trip to essentially travel from Morocco to South Africa hugging the Atlantic coast of Africa. I have a few questions about some specifics.

I will be doing the trip by bicycle so it would involve lots of wild camping, I understand that always carries risks but are there any specific risks to that region which I wouldn’t have encountered in Europe/Asia/South America? I speak good French and English so there shouldn’t be an issue with languages for the most part until Angola

Given the nature of the trip it would be very hard to organise all my visas in advance, are there any countries where it would be impossible for a European to obtain a visa from an embassy in a neighbouring country?

The only country I would avoid completely is the DRC, and I would instead take a boat around it by entering Angola on its border with the republic of the Congo. The only other countries I have some concerns about are Cameroon, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Cameroon is pretty unavoidable but I could easily skip Liberia and Sierra Leone if they are too dangerous.

solotravel,"Most people have fun traveling but there can sometimes be parts that aren’t very fun or are very eye opening. Have your travel experiences ever made you upset or angry because of what you saw, heard, or experienced?

I have been living in Mexico for about 6mo and in this time I have seen the following: 

-	People living in shanties. The lady two doors down from me has two kids and the grandmother living in a place that’s the size of a studio apartment. Three people sleep on a double size bed and the other person sleeps on a makeshift blanket bed on the floor. 
-	People who are so desperate for money that they are selling small packs of gum for 10 cents or washing windshields at a stop light. 
-	People missing limbs or blind that are out on the street begging. 
-	Women treated with so much disrespect. 

The worst feeling is that I feel powerless to do anything about it. I can’t donate to every single person begging or buy something from every single vendor. The best I can do is support small vendors like my local taco stand or the local fruit lady. 

It makes me angry when I check Facebook and see friends in the US complaining about their local Whole Foods being closed for renovations, whining about the weather, or complaining about someone using the wrong pronouns when there are people in this world who don’t even have a safe place to live or women are regularly harassed on the street and can’t go out after dark.

solotravel,"Just got home…went out last Thursday on a Harley Street 750 I made the following trip (left last Thursday morning):
I went from Atlanta to Jacksonville, FL the first day. Used no highways or interstates, I just set my iPhone to get me there without using highways. Visited an old friend I hadn’t seen in years and who’s been feeling poorly ( yes, social  distancing, etc.). 
Next morning, I headed down hwy. 1 (which  becomes A1A) from Jacksonville. Basically following the coast in the Atlantic side. Didn’t even know it was Bike Week in Daytona. I think I may have temporarily joined a gang while driving through town. Anyway, the next morning I got up and drove to Fort Lauderdale and hung out with a friend on the beach. Found a great condo for two nights and did magic mushrooms in 20 mph winds on the beach. That’s it’s own chapter. After that 2 day beachside adventure, I got up feeling great and sober and strong on Monday and drove straight south and then west  across the Everglades. Saw alligators and lots of beautiful scenery. Still haven’t been on the highway or interstate. Flipped north when I hit Carenesville, FL.  and aimed for Ocala. Made it to about 30 miles south of there and spent the night in a Best Western. Got up this morning and just put in the work… 8 1/2 hours of riding, over 400 miles.

Amenable to whatever, I love being outdoors and active (hiking, biking especially) but also enjoy lots of downtime. Pretty outgoing so I like to make friends and will talk to most people.

Would I be able to enjoy some of the ""must see/do"" things, or just life more generally? These are all incredible places but it would be a shame to visit and not experience some of the daily life.

(b) **How easy is it to travel between different regions?** Should I always be ready to provide proof of reservation at a ""classified"" Moroccan hotel/riad, as the tourism website suggests?

Anyways, I also have a history of being verbally and emotionally abused by a family member. I am extremely sensitive to arguments/yelling and just instantly shut down. I know if I give in to then I will deeply regret it, especially as I've been stuck in a basement with barely any contact this list year.

solotravel,"Hello,

I am really interested in teaching abroad and am in the process of getting my TESOL certificate. Besides that, I would like to travel alone sometime after graduation (for a few months or however long the visa will allow) to visit friends. But I’m worried about the availability of my medication, both its legality (don’t wanna get arrested at a border) and refills (if I stay somewhere for very long I would need to get it refilled there). 

I (22f) recently got diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Adderall XR. It is working pretty well and because it is my doctor is only pursuing finding the right dosage of that for now. She won’t listen when I say that taking something illegal in so many countries (because of the amphetamine) impairs my ability to live and work abroad. She says I need to graduate college first before I worry about anything else and while she is right I worry about the future a lot and like to have at least a plan to fall back on or a list of feasible possibilities. 

My original plan was to teach in South Korea because that’s where I did my study abroad and I have an intermediate grasp of the language. However it is illegal there and while you can bring up to a three month supply of medications with you if you get permission in advance of your visit (normally takes a few months) and they don’t normally check what prescriptions you have with you at the border, I would be out of luck after three months. I know Adderall / amphetamine-based stimulants are illegal in a lot of countries (Japan, Korea, etc.) and probably impossible to get a prescription for in even more others.

My question is: are there any countries where you can get prescribed Adderall, and fill it at a local pharmacy? I searched online but couldn’t find a list. As for whether I can get a teaching job there is another matter I can research on my own, but there’s no point researching programs if the medicine I take is illegal there. Also even traveling there on my own would be impossible if it’s arrest-you-at-the-border level illegal in that country. It just sucks that I put all this time and effort into taking a TESOL course (not to mention all the Korea-specific research I did) to have it derailed like this, as well as making it hard to visit friends like I had planned to (I went to an international high school so they are spread across the world).

I’d also like to avoid any long, desolate stretches of highway where I may run out of gas and be murdered or something.

solotravel,"Hey, this might be a rather odd question but I've been wondering if anyone else went through the same thing.

So I planned to travel the world for a couple of years and my first destination was Australia. I've been here a little over a year and will probably stay until 2022 (you know why). 

Prior to this I made up my mind about all the things I would pack and what not (I'm only focusing on clothes right now!). I watched a billion videos, read tons of blog articles and looked back on my first backpacking trips to check on what I truly needed. It all came down to light, comfortable and functional clothing. So I bought all of this stuff that I'd usually would never wear. Here's the point: It isn't my style. I don't feel comfortable at all wearing it. And there is hardly anything that I could buy that matches the ""backpacking""-box. It sounds so stupid, I know, but the clothes that I'd normally wear are way too bulky and heavy to travel with. Say you'd normally wear baggy streetwear but for the sake of traveling you'd switch to the surfer style as it's ""lighter"" and easier to travel with. Does that make any sense?

I'm not even a ""trendsetter"" or wear any special or pricey brands. I just miss wearing clothes that I actually like. Or even going shopping or having a wider range of clothing options. But it doesn't seem to fit into my lifestyle right now. Has anyone experienced something similar? What did you do about it?

I will be flying so I am trying to stay in or very close to a city with a decent sized airport. I have tentatively narrowed down my choices to Denver, Boise, Portland, or Billings. I am certainly open to other suggestions though! 

Some of the things I enjoy are historical districts &amp; museums, craft breweries, live music, and a decent nightlife. I would like to be somewhat thrifty and be able to stretch my dollars as far as possible so I prefer walking instead of getting Ubers.

I make beats and do vocals, though I'm traveling for my own personal reasons, it'd be cool to gauge what areas might be great for just being around music and inspiring art/artists

solotravel,"Just thinking ahead for my C/SAmerica trip down the line. I love staying in hostels and meeting people and going out for drinks and having a laugh. But at 30/31, I'm not sure that living like this whilst travelling is so smart in terms of, waking up to hangovers in hostels which seems like something I should be doing at 20, not to mention throwing away money. Yet, it's such a fantastic way to meet people. In Lisbon, I entered my dorm room and 10 minutes later was in the kitchen drinking wine with a group. We ended up plastered. It's fun for a bit but it also seems not so wise to do this regularly. The next 4/5 days were similar to that, waking up late to a sore head, sleep deprived etc. Yet, it's the best way to meet people at hostels.

solotravel,"Hi community!

I am currently a 24 year-old \[F\] living in Canada, in a big metropolitan city. I've traveled quite a bit (30+ countries) either with family (mostly) or close friends (1-2 places). My family are big travelers, and we usually travel 3-4 times a year. We usually stay in hotels with full amenities, and usually do the ""touristy"" stuff. 

I recently graduated and am making around 65k per year. I wanted to take 2-3 months off to travel to SEA with a close friend but due to the pandemic, I got a job right away. My contract ends in 2022 as I am currently replacing someone who's on leave. I was thinking about traveling solo for about 6 months with the savings that I will have made after 2 years of work. I live on my own, and pay expenses, so I'm not too sure how much money I'll have on the side, but hoping it'll be around 25k by the end of the two years just for those 6 months. 

I am mainly interested in traveling in Asia and the parts of Europe I haven't done. I am also interested in visiting the United Emirates and some parts of the middle East (don't have a concrete plan yet).

I had a few questions prior: 

1) How has solo traveling been to those who have only traveled in pairs or with family? I'm quite social but do get shy in situations where I don't know anyone. I like to have people around generally. I am not the type of person who's go to a movie alone or who'd eat out alone, although this may change once I'm in the situation.

2) For those who have traveled with family and stayed in hotels, etc., how was the shift from that comfort to let's say a hostel? 

3) For those who left for 6+ months, how easy was it to find a job afterwards with such a gap in your CV/resume? 

4) Are there any countries that you wouldn't recommend for someone who has no solo experience and is a female? I've heard about some parts of the Middle East (such as Egypt and Morocco). 

5) I currently own a place of my own, which I renovated some months ago. I was thinking about having someone live there for 6-months (perhaps a student) but I'm afraid of leaving someone there unattended while I'm away (would it be smarter to just have it person-free for 6 months?).

solotravel,"Hi guys. I’ve travelled a few times (during the pandemic) for personal and work reasons, and I’d like to share some websites I check before embarking on an adventure across the globe.

* Great Escape - even before Covid, Great Escape is my prefered flight aggregator website. Before, they only showed the cheapest flights but when the pandemic started, they also put a feature where you can see Covid guides. These guides include the number of active cases, outbreak trend, and government restrictions. A very, very great tool.
* Covid Controls: A covid-19 dashboard that shows which countries are open for travellers. A great tool for planning.
* Visa List - if you have little to no idea how powerful your passport is, you can check it through Visa List. Like Great Escape, it also shows what countries are open to your country of origin during the current pandemic.
* AirBnB - I know, AirBnB’s well known, but using it during this time is crucial. Personally, I prefer lodging reservations than walk-ins, simply because I can ensure that the place is already disinfected before the time of my arrival. And among all of the booking sites out there, AirBnB is one of the most strict.
* Trip Expert - Trip Expert is like the “New York Times best selling” review site. Unlike other sites, they’re reviewed by travel experts and publications.
* Travel Hero: This simple tool tells you when is a good time to travel to a certain country. Aside from that, it also shows what activities you can do every month, wildlife sightings, and overall weather. Another great tool for planning trips.

Those are it. I’ll be travelling again soon and my advice is to respect your destination’s protocols. If they’re requiring you to wear a mask, then do so. If they ask you to go under quarantine, do it. It’s your responsibility to not only keep yourself safe, but also the people on your destination. And please please, get yourselves tested before traveling.",Sites I check before travelling alone during the pandemic.,"Hi guys.

solotravel,"So here's the plan. 23 years old, male, bigger build and not nervous alone when abroad, spent a bit of time backpacking Europe so I know how to be safe/protect myself, no debt, bit of savings and need adventure of a lifetime. When covid ends I'm hitting the road. I want to start in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. Maybe continue south through Malaysia and Indonesia.

I've seen a lot of discussion from budget backpackers that these countries can average out to about 30$ a day. Most of the costs once arrived are in transport, food, and accomodation. The way I see the world of backpacking, money is time. I know 30$ is insanely cheap for traveling. But multiply that by a 60 day vacation and you've suddenly spent a small fortune. When you have more money, you can travel longer. So how am I gonna make this work?

I want to make my funds last as long as possible. I plan on hitchhiking, and sleeping in a hammock 5-6 days a week. Eating only what the locals eat. Does anybody have any sources on people who have done this. All the ""cost breakdowns"" I've seen have a bit more luxuries. I have ZERO interest in staying in loud party hostels, drinking, and hanging out with americans. I just kind of want to wander around, write a journal, read some books, do some freediving, and see where the adventure takes me.  I haven't been able to find many first hand experiences that this can be done. It seems like most travel blogs are looking for luxuries just a bit higher than what I have in mind. (i know it sounds strange to call hostels luxuries but hear me out!). I've considered that maybe my perception of SE Asia is not based on what's actually possible and maybe this is too much of a stretch.

I hope to keep my costs under 4000 USD and stretch that out for 1-2 years (permitting I can make the visas work). By my math, 4000 / (360\*2) = 5.55 USD per day. This is a fraction of what most youtubers/bloggers are recommending but I figure if you cut out the daily hostel and train/bus ticket costs, then maybe this is actually possible.

I can see two obvious flaws in my analysis:

1. I'm not even sure if you can just walk off the path and set up a hammock. I've seen that it MIGHT be possible in some places but might be illegal in others. I'll be getting a good quality set up with tarp and bug net so I don't think the weather will be an issue. Also, I've heard of some people/ hostels being cool with you hanging up your hammock for free.
2. From what I can read online, it's still hard to tell if its possible to hitchhike in all these places. I've seen some say that its super easy and locals love picking up westerners because they love to chat. Since trains and buses are so cheap, it seems like most travelers that plan on 1-3 month travel just prefer to pay for tickets. But like accommodations, this strategy adds up quickly and just isn't feasible for me long term.

If I run out of money, I'm thinking of a New Zealand or Australian working holiday visa to extend my time abroad which is why I'm thinking about the north to south route to finish in Australia.

Appreciate any thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: 

Ok, first of all, thanks for the insight. Alot to consider.

Second. Maybe setting the budget at 5.55 and then seeing what that gets you is the wrong approach. Maybe this is better looked at from a different perspective. Assuming you cut out the things I mentioned (busses, hostels, western food, tours, etc.), what would THAT daily cost be and how much do we save compared to the usual 25-30$ that is budgeted for people who do plan to be in hostels 7 nights a week, going on tours, and buying bus, train and plane tickets. 10$? 15$? 20$? From there, I could do the math to figure out how long that will let me travel based on the savings I want to blow.

I wasn't trying to say this COULD be done on 5.55. I meant to say that for people looking for a different experience than the standard, there is a lot less ""budget breakdowns"" and general tips. Which got me wondering, does this mean it can't be done (locals/ police won't let you so dont try hitchhiking or hammocking) or does the maybe mean the type of people who do that just don't make youtube channels, idk!.

Also, I fully agree, NZ our AUS would probably be a good idea to do first but I've also heard that a lot of people who do that year really don't make much savings after all the associated costs of living in those countries are covered. Since Asia is the goal and I don't really have any in demand skills for NZ, except maybe some aquaculture or tourism industry work, I'm not sold on it.

This is why i decided to make this post to tell you about the current situation and also with a very cautious look into the recent future.

Of course i am no scientist and no expert, but i am a thinking person and making plan is one thing, but chosing the right time for them, is something else.

I am in the south, sicily. The place, where it is the hottest all year long and where summer starts in may. (make your own reasoning)

As for now i can tell you, that many people in hospitality have already postponed a possible start for the season from the regular easter time, to July.

IF they even open up the borders. Currently Italy is thinking of maybe allowing EU citizens to enter, non-EU seems to be out of question.

Some tourist guides and the tourist  association i needed to meet for work have painted a quite dark picture. Logically many customers have cancelled their summer trips and so some facilities have simply decided to not accept any bookings until june. also because they always lose money/rating if they decline or cancel. If they do, be aware that the cancel policy will probably be to your disadvantage.

The vaccination process is rather slow here. Even though i have a medical condition i might get it somewhen end-summerish (which in italy means winter, lol). This also means, that letting people enter is putting at risk the local population.

The politics tried to make it all seems under control but with the current change in power in the government, many things have been slowed down.

It isn't even allowed to cross regions at the moment and though it seemed to be lifted, it simply didn't but got worse, especially in the north.

Until now there have maybe been talks, but as it isn't sure that the first vaccine also helps against the new variants, being vaccinated doesn't change your right to enter.

So to save you time, money and nerves: think twice about your travel plans to italy this summer for some beaching in capri.

I know this isn't happy talk, but i hope i could provide some insight. And honestly, i think this applies to all of europe \[sic\]",For all of you thinking about going to Italy this summer,"I have been reading some posts of planning (and already booking flights) to go to Italy for the summer or so this year and have been pretty surprised.

solotravel,"Hello everyone! 

Along with many other people I’ve been very fortunate and have been able to save money aside while working from home. With the end of this whole situation very very slightly in sight I feel like it’s coming towards the time to start planning finally going on a big trip. I’m 23M and have thought about it for a while but finally feels realistic 

I mainly wanted to hear people’s thoughts on leaving a job to go travel for say 4/6 months or maybe more. For me that’s the biggest producer of anxiety for a trip, coming back to nothing. Not sure a sabbatical is realistic at my place now

What gave you the courage to just up and leave?
Did you just come to terms with a few months job searching when you get back with money you kept aside for when return?

I was supposed to go with my boyfriend, but in case that doesn't happen ... has any young female in their twenties done Jamaica alone?  I would be hitting Ocho Rios, Negril, Montego Bay but I don't want a typical resort experience. Ideally, I would also like to explore some of the rural towns too, as I am a photographer.

Bit of background: I am mixed race, dad's got a lot of West Indies mixed heritage and my mom is Korean but I  doubt I would 'blend in' with the locals there. I've been to Kingston before, very briefly and stayed in an area I think they described as a business district. I wasn't alone. Did feel a bit sketchy but that could have been me having my guard up vs the actual environment - I was also very young (17) in the company of adults.

I am quite extroverted although I do need my alone time - i'm not interested in making lifelong friendships or connections aside from those warm and ephemeral 'let's help each other out' type understandings that develop between travelers.  I guess what i'm trying to say is, I am perfectly happy being by myself for this trip, and it is not my goal to 'meet people'.  I happily welcome stories and insight from locals and other travelers alike and value that as part of the experience.. but I won't get 'lonely' or 'bored' being by myself. Safety is my only concern really...

\- Will I need to find travel groups to move around or can I safely execute a trip truly 'solo'?

\- Any experiences with resorts vs hostels vs airbnb type situations?

\- Transportation tips are welcome as well.

* How are taxi drivers - and has anyone struck a deal with a driver in an area and used the same driver while they're there? this is usually what I try to do.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Cool locations you've scouted if you are also a photographer/videographer

I love dancing and nightlife, live music, but it’s not a must - willing to omit it from my itinerary.

I don't have a lot of solo travel experience. Only true solo trips would be Italy - where I struggled in some areas. Uh, a lot of ""are you lost baby girl?"" vibes in Napoli lol

I've been to Thailand alone as well.

Japan.

Parts of the U.S. (I live in Korea).

solotravel,"Hi folks

For some reason I've always wanted to drive across the US (or do 66). Car either way. I struggle with planning and which route to take, especially in the ""middle"" of the country.

I've extensively roadtripped all over the US - Southwest from West coast into NM, Highway 1 plus once including the entire coast up to Seattle, NOLA to FL up the coast into GA, New England - and variations of all of these. I've also been randomly to Chicago and Yellowstone NP (though I wouldn't hate seeing this one again).

I love cities and nature alike. I've seen most of the Southwest NPs at least once, including some lesser known ones. I love them all and am also open to seeing them again.

Places I have on my radar but am just not quite sure if they're worth it and how to best string (some of) them together:

* Austin 
* actually Texas generally
* Nashville 
* maybe Memphis too?
* Mt Rushmore
* Blue Ridge Mts
* Denver or generally Colorado
* Rocky Mts (have driven through CO, but never properly stopped)


I love driving on my own, don't mind the occasional full driving day, budget is no hurdle and duration is flexible (ideally 5 weeks tops, though can also be longer if needed). I'm also open to breaking up the trip and taking a flight in between two parts of the trip if that makes more sense or in case there really is just nothing to see. I can start anywhere and stop anywhere.

I also wouldn't mind seeing Chicago again as it's been 15 years since I was last there - but not a must. I don't need to spend time in any of the big cities on either coast as I've been to them on various trips many many times.

Any tip, idea, thought is welcome.

Cheers

I love driving on my own, don't mind the occasional full driving day, budget is no hurdle and duration is flexible (ideally 5 weeks tops, though can also be longer if needed). I'm also open to breaking up the trip and taking a flight in between two parts of the trip if that makes more sense or in case there really is just nothing to see. I can start anywhere and stop anywhere.

I also wouldn't mind seeing Chicago again as it's been 15 years since I was last there - but not a must. I don't need to spend time in any of the big cities on either coast as I've been to them on various trips many many times.

Any tip, idea, thought is welcome.

Cheers

Since many countries installed various restrictions in the past few months, it has become annoying to travel around Europe. Then I started thinking about riding a bike across the continent. Also, as I move to the Netherlands soon, a bike will be a necessity. However, I still have some concerns regarding the travel.

1. Is it easy to find a place to take care of your bike in Europe? For example, if there is something wrong, I might need to repair it. Also, is there any repair toolkit I can buy?
2. The safety of the bike is always a concern, especially in big cities. Typically, how do you do to keep them intact besides a lock?
3. What kind of bike is better equipped for long-distance travel? I plan to have a road bicycle. Is it a good choice?

solotravel,"Sometime next year I'm hoping to embark on a longer trip around the world, potentially for a year or so. But rather than be on the move all the time, I'd love to have a couple of places where I could just rent an apartment and stay in for a month or two. Somewhere to rest, and spend more time getting to know the place. Maybe go to a class or something along those lines! 

I've not looked into it much, but I know that not everywhere lets you stay so long, and renting an apartment isn't such an easy thing to do in a lot of places. So I was wondering if anyone has any good suggestions, or had done something like that somewhere themselves? 

Ideally it would be:

- Not *horribly* expensive. Prefferably under $1000 a month for a full private apartment. (cheaper is better!)
- A large city with plenty to see and do. 
- English friendly. (doesn't need to be English speaking, but somewhere where you can get by easily enough with English)
- If not a large city, then a very nice environment. Like a very mountainous region, or a nice beach. 
- Good public transport, and low crime.
- Lots of day trips to go on. 

As I said I've not looked into it too much, but my current thoughts are (I live in the UK):

- Hong Kong
- Singapore 
- Barcelona
- Somewhere in the USA (Miami/Vegas/NYC/San Francisco/Chicago/Honolulu)
- Bangkok
- Somewhere in Australia or NZ (Sydney/Melbourne/Auckland)

Edit* just to expand, it doesn't necessarily need to be a traditional apartment. An airBnB room would work just fine! A hotel room with some kitchen facilities would also be just fine. (maybe even a hotel room without a kitchen, if it is somewhere with really cheap food prices)","What are some good countries/cities to rent an apartment, and stay in for a month or two?","Sometime next year I'm hoping to embark on a longer trip around the world, potentially for a year or so.

solotravel,"Hey guys, 

I’m British, And I have been thinking about doing a 2 month trip to South America this summer (If Corona has calmed down by then). (See post history for details). South America, and Brazil especially, has always fascinated me - I have an sort of weird obsession with the place from an academic (I’m very into economics) and cultural standpoint. 

At first I was really excited and confident I could do it: although it’d be my first time solo travelling, I’m fortunate enough to have done many budget trips with my parents to Europe, the US and India (where I’m from originally), and travelled internationally alone as well to see family. 

I knew my parents wouldn’t be very open to the idea, but I thought I could convince them. Needless to say, I couldn’t. They said that even if I pay for 100% of the trip myself, they wouldn’t support or be in favour the decision. They say because I haven’t lived fully alone in university yet that I’m not ready to go abroad and stay in hostels alone. 

For the record, when we travel usually, it’s me who makes the plans, deals with navigation etc etc. I’m responsible when it comes to travelling. But understandably, my parents are worried if something goes wrong, I’m not “experienced” (this word came up a lot) to go alone. They said they’d only support such a trip When I’m 21 or 22. 

Now, I still plan on going if I can earn enough money by summer (which I should do in the next few months) and Corona has settled, as I’ll be an adult. 

But my parents saying I’m not “experienced” enough has really knocked my confidence . I’m worried I’m over stretching myself by travelling solo At 18, let alone for 2 months in a part of the world that’s new to me. I don’t know if i should still go.

I’ve  done lots of research on the safety side of things, especially in Rio, but that’s also a source of concern as is expected, although I know all the major precautions to take (dress down, no walking alone, only take taxis at night, carry a decoy wallet and phone...) 

I’m also nervous about staying in hostels, again, especially after my parents disapproval. I’ll probably be the youngest, will I hate it? Will I have trouble falling asleep? I like meeting new people and learning about new cultures a lot, if that’s of any relevance. 

My childhood and home life has been... traumatic, to say the least, and I’ve grown and changed so much in the last few years. I really need time to myself to introspect and think. To truly become my own best friend. I definitely don’t want to spend the summer before university sitting At home if it’s safe to travel abroad. 

On the other hand, people say not to take decisions out of fear, 

I don’t know, I guess I’m just waffling on at this point, but does anybody have any thoughts? Am I an idiot for even considering something like this? Let me know. Thanks for reading this far.","Shrinking Confidence to Travel Alone (18y/o, Male)","Hey guys,

Hey guys,

A few months back I posted about wanting to do a Solo trip to South America this summer for 2 months, if Coronavirus is calmed down. I’ll be 18 years old, it’ll be my first solo trip, and will be before I go to university. 

After LOTS of research, I’m convinced that safety wise although there is a risk, I should not make decisions out of fear, and precautions like dressing down, not going out alone at night, not walking around alone in Rio, only taking taxis after dark, keeping a decoy wallet with some cash and a fake extra phone should keep me out of harms way. I know Spanish fairly well (I was fluent but I’m a bit rustier now, I’m going to go over it) and am learning Portuguese (everyday I’m spending some time, should be decent by summer). 

I live in the UK but am from India originally, which I have visited many times with family, and I’m fortunate enough to have done many budget trips to Europe and the US with family, which I usually end up planning, so I’m not worried about not being responsible enough for a trip like this.  

After seeing replies from my posts and doing research, I’ve come up with this schedule. Please comment any suggestions and advice. (I’m a city/history/architecture/economics and politics guy so am mainly visiting those).

Transport: £1120

For the top class of bus for all journeys where available 

Accommodation: £432 

For hostels in safe parts of town + a hotel in one or two cities like Brasilia for a “break”

solotravel,"Hello Reddit,

I’m 17, I’m in my first year of college and I live in the UK. Over the past few months (maybe due to Lockdown boredom) I’ve had an increased urge to see the world whilst i’m still young and have my health. However, though I’ve always maintained I will wait until a gap year after college, I am starting to grow a little bit restless and impatient. I have a friend who may potentially be on board as a travel partner, but nothing is for certain.

I was wondering if theoretically, even if it be within the UK (due to Covid etc), I could realistically solo travel this summer, despite being 17. I don’t know 100% what disadvantages that would bring, but I know i’m beginning to feel wanderlust.

solotravel,"As stated in the title, I am looking for suggestions for the best destinations (outside of US, Canada, and Mexico) for a first time female solo traveler.  

In the past few years, I’ve discovered that I love to travel.  Unfortunately, it is not something I’ve been able to do due to COVID.  However, I would like to start planning for when things open up. 

Background about me: 
- I recently turned 30 
- From the US 
- Never traveled internationally by myself, it has always been with other people. 
- Traveled solo within the US once.  Fun experience overall but I found myself getting bored at times.  I would like to try again, but internationally, to challenge myself and grow.  It’s also difficult to plan with friends now as we are all in different stages of life.  
- Languages I know: English, Urdu, high school level French 
- I am an introvert and find it hard to approach and talk to people I don’t know, but I’m trying to get out of my comfort zone. 

Requirements: 
- I would like to make my first time trip short, maybe about a week, to try out solo travel. 
- A safe destination for a female traveling alone. 
- Somewhere I can get away with knowing the language minimally, or where English is spoken widely. 
- Somewhere where I can meet people easily too if I find my own company boring for a change of pace. 

Places outside of US I’ve traveled to already: 
- Mexico (Mexico City, Riviera Maya, Tulum, and Cozumel) 
- Honduras (Roatan)
- Thailand (Chiang Mai and Phuket) 
- France (Paris) 
- Canada (Toronto, Banff, other various parts) 
- South Korea (Seoul)

solotravel,"26 year old single male, I am a teacher, and one of my biggest dreams in life is to travel and experience the nation/world (granted there’s only a few places I want to see outside the US). 

I have a small group of friends, they all have ordinary 9-5 jobs or civil service jobs, go home to their wives and/or gfs and families, and relax or we hang out with each other. On the weekends we spend one night going out.

Now I have no issue with this, I love my life, we represent like most of the populations daily routine, haha, but I feel like I should be different, unique, to shoot for the stars when it comes to my life dreams.  My issue is, I have a couple of friends who always talk about going places (the things I’ve heard that never went through, a cruise, Mexico, etc. is ridiculous), but we never do it. I was supposed to hit Vegas this summer but I know it ain’t happening. My family goes away 2-3x  a year, but it’s always the same three places.

So my question/advice I need is, should I just say screw it and begin traveling solo this year? I’m tired of waiting around for people, if this is my life dream I should pursue it now right? I genuinely believe if I begin traveling alone, others will be inspired and follow, and I’ll also befriend people on my solo travels who love traveling also. I’ve been to Arizona multiple times, but I want to go this year and experience the Grand Canyon, I want to experience San Diego over the summer, Yellowstone and Olympic national park, etc. 

This will help me build myself and improve myself into someone interesting, more intelligent (I guess that’s the word, maybe more cultured? Haha), just improving myself overall, following my dreams. I recently read a book and one chapter explained how people should be polarizing and controversial, and for some reason, this dream of traveling made me think about that. I think of Kanye West “shoot for the stars and if you fall you’ll land on a cloud.”

solotravel,"I'm 46 years old, and Male. This creates a pretty serious problem for the type of travel I do.

You see, I've been backpacking the world on and off for over 20 years, staying in hostels each and every time. They're an amazing place to meet new people, socialize, have a brief romantic liaison, arrange trips, meet other travelers and so forth.

I hate hotels with a passion. But as I've gotten older, I've run into a phenomena that all hostel regulars know well.

For those of you that do the same, you'll be aware that there are plenty of Hostel stereotypes that you'll tend to find one of in every hostel in the world. British 'lads on tour' sporting horrific sunburns, or the 'hippie dickhead with a guitar' are pretty common, and you'll find them in most hostels.

One of the most enduring stereotypes however is 'the creepy old guy in the Hostel'. The middle aged or older dude that would be a sex pest to girls half his age, walk around in his undies and so forth. It's such a trope, that every older bloke in a Hostel is assumed to be a creepy older guy, until he proves himself otherwise.

There is nothing more isolating than being at a Hostel full of people having a good time, and you're invisible on account of your age.

The question is for those of us blokes that love the social side of hostels, but are on the wrong side of 35 or so, *how do you break the stereotype of being 'the creepy old guy at the hostel'?*

Here are some tips I learnt on the way to try and compensate for being the oldest dude in every one of them I visited (some slightly tongue in cheek):

1. It goes without saying, but *'avoid being creepy'. T*hat should be a given - **you don't walk around in your underwear, ruthlessly hitting on girls young enough to be your daughter.** Dont do it.
2. Work at the hostel, or befriend those that do, as they kind of have to be nice to you. It's a rule that Hostel staff are generally 'the clique to know' in Hostels. You can balance out peoples wariness of you on account of being an older dude, by simply working there. As a bonus, you can extend your RTW trip by getting free accommodation.
3. Avoid checking in to a party hostel solo (or avoid them altogether). Meet and befriend other travelers before-hand and check in and hang out with them, using them as a 'beard' to partly camouflage yourself. You wont end up being the lonely old guy in a room full of people partying.
4. If you must check in solo, look for another guy travelling solo to hang with, or a receptive group of guys to break into early. Avoid befriending a girl, as she'll think you're hitting on her (and you're trying to avoid that), and even if you're not or she doesn't think you are, she's a good chance to bail on you the instant a hotter younger guy makes a move, leaving you again, flying solo in a room full of people partying who have already formed groups.
5. Remember you're not in college anymore; don't act like you are unless you're absolutely sure you can pull it off. It'll likely only make you seem more out of place. Let your hair down and have fun, but be a little mindful of your age. *Especially* on dance floors. In fact, you should probably avoid dance floors altogether.
6. Be understanding if people are stand-offish at first. People generally seek out other people in the same demographic as them. You likely didn't want to party or even hang out with someone as old as your own Dad when you were young. Why should they? Don't let your own isolation or feelings of not fitting in turn into anger at other people being wary of you. It'll only make you less social and them more wary.
7. **Under no circumstances hit on a girl more than 10 years your junior** unless you're getting a green light, so bright it literally blinds you. As in... if she hasn't spent the entire night telling you about her last boyfriend 'who was older than you but not as hot as you', how she 'actively prefers older men', how 'age is just a number', casually drops the fact she has a private room that night, and touches your leg every 2 minutes, don't even try it. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth of course, but you'd better be damn sure before you bring your flirt game. Just don't do it.
8. You've been doing this caper for a long time. You have countless stories of your travel adventures and hostel shenanigan's. Use them. The funnier the better. Be mindful to avoid dad jokes though. Nothing makes you look more like a sad middle aged dude than a dad joke.
9. Dress more your age. 'Sunday Funday' or 'Full Moon Party' singlets make you look like more of a try-hard than they do on 20 year olds, and 10"" Board shorts are not for middle aged men. Dressing like a teenager is not going to help you blend in; it'll have the opposite effect.
10. Instead of constantly fretting about your age and how people might perceive you, embrace your age as a point of difference. Points of differences can be a good thing if you play them right. Confidence is attractive. Be confident, and lean into it. Travelers are an open minded bunch generally, and if you're confident in who you are, open and not a dickhead, you'll go far.

Basically gentlemen, what I'm getting at is be prepared for a certain level of wariness, but understand it, embrace it and roll with it.

Anyone else dealt with this and have any more advice for the older male hostel-goers on here (other than 'dont go')?

**Edited**: to clarify in bold (for the avoidance of any doubt) the fact I am telling you older gentleman not to be a creep who goes to hostels only to hit on younger women. Apparently some people have taken the above to be a manifesto on HOW to pick up younger women (??). It's hard enough as a middle aged dude in a hostel, I dont want to be made a pariah on account of your sleazy creepy BS.

Dont do it. Its those precise fears that stop middle aged blokes from long term travel, when hostels are full of solo female travelers in their 30's and 40's.

&amp;#x200B;",You're a middle aged man in a hostel... how to avoid being the 'creepy old guy'?,"I'm 46 years old, and Male. This creates a pretty serious problem for the type of travel I do.

You see, I've been backpacking the world on and off for over 20 years, staying in hostels each and every time. They're an amazing place to meet new people, socialize, have a brief romantic liaison, arrange trips, meet other travelers and so forth.

I hate hotels with a passion. But as I've gotten older, I've run into a phenomena that all hostel regulars know well.

For those of you that do the same, you'll be aware that there are plenty of Hostel stereotypes that you'll tend to find one of in every hostel in the world. British 'lads on tour' sporting horrific sunburns, or the 'hippie dickhead with a guitar' are pretty common, and you'll find them in most hostels.

One of the most enduring stereotypes however is 'the creepy old guy in the Hostel'. The middle aged or older dude that would be a sex pest to girls half his age, walk around in his undies and so forth. It's such a trope, that every older bloke in a Hostel is assumed to be a creepy older guy, until he proves himself otherwise.

There is nothing more isolating than being at a Hostel full of people having a good time, and you're invisible on account of your age.

The question is for those of us blokes that love the social side of hostels, but are on the wrong side of 35 or so, *how do you break the stereotype of being 'the creepy old guy at the hostel'?*

Here are some tips I learnt on the way to try and compensate for being the oldest dude in every one of them I visited (some slightly tongue in cheek):

1. It goes without saying, but *'avoid being creepy'. T*hat should be a given - **you don't walk around in your underwear, ruthlessly hitting on girls young enough to be your daughter.** Dont do it.
2. Work at the hostel, or befriend those that do, as they kind of have to be nice to you. It's a rule that Hostel staff are generally 'the clique to know' in Hostels. You can balance out peoples wariness of you on account of being an older dude, by simply working there. As a bonus, you can extend your RTW trip by getting free accommodation.
3. Avoid checking in to a party hostel solo (or avoid them altogether). Meet and befriend other travelers before-hand and check in and hang out with them, using them as a 'beard' to partly camouflage yourself. You wont end up being the lonely old guy in a room full of people partying.
4. If you must check in solo, look for another guy travelling solo to hang with, or a receptive group of guys to break into early. Avoid befriending a girl, as she'll think you're hitting on her (and you're trying to avoid that), and even if you're not or she doesn't think you are, she's a good chance to bail on you the instant a hotter younger guy makes a move, leaving you again, flying solo in a room full of people partying who have already formed groups.
5. Remember you're not in college anymore; don't act like you are unless you're absolutely sure you can pull it off. It'll likely only make you seem more out of place. Let your hair down and have fun, but be a little mindful of your age. *Especially* on dance floors. In fact, you should probably avoid dance floors altogether.
6. Be understanding if people are stand-offish at first. People generally seek out other people in the same demographic as them. You likely didn't want to party or even hang out with someone as old as your own Dad when you were young. Why should they? Don't let your own isolation or feelings of not fitting in turn into anger at other people being wary of you. It'll only make you less social and them more wary.
7. **Under no circumstances hit on a girl more than 10 years your junior** unless you're getting a green light, so bright it literally blinds you. As in... if she hasn't spent the entire night telling you about her last boyfriend 'who was older than you but not as hot as you', how she 'actively prefers older men', how 'age is just a number', casually drops the fact she has a private room that night, and touches your leg every 2 minutes, don't even try it. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth of course, but you'd better be damn sure before you bring your flirt game. Just don't do it.
8. You've been doing this caper for a long time. You have countless stories of your travel adventures and hostel shenanigan's. Use them. The funnier the better. Be mindful to avoid dad jokes though. Nothing makes you look more like a sad middle aged dude than a dad joke.
9. Dress more your age. 'Sunday Funday' or 'Full Moon Party' singlets make you look like more of a try-hard than they do on 20 year olds, and 10"" Board shorts are not for middle aged men. Dressing like a teenager is not going to help you blend in; it'll have the opposite effect.
10. Instead of constantly fretting about your age and how people might perceive you, embrace your age as a point of difference. Points of differences can be a good thing if you play them right. Confidence is attractive. Be confident, and lean into it. Travelers are an open minded bunch generally, and if you're confident in who you are, open and not a dickhead, you'll go far.

Basically gentlemen, what I'm getting at is be prepared for a certain level of wariness, but understand it, embrace it and roll with it.

I used to take a few weeks off of work each year and travel freely between cities, countries, treks, hikes, sleep at airports, trains, etc...

When the pandemic began, I was thinking that I would be the first to get on a plane as soon as they allowed me, but my better conscience is always in my head thinking that it is selfish to so and I am putting others at risk for my enjoyment.

solotravel,"January 2020 I set out to travel south east Asia and then the next year see more. I went solo and was planning this trip for a long time. Obviously vivid hit and I spent all of 2020 traveling around Thailand and still here. In the beginning I had some times of being lonely but then I met great people everywhere I went. So I wanted to give everyone a quick tips on meeting people.

1. One of the fastest ways to meetup with people that isn't putting yourself out there so much is Facebook events. It really is one of if not the best thing to do in finding people like you or that have an interest you do. I found this in Chiang Mai because Meetup didn't have anything going really.

2. Meetup dot com. Because groups have to pay to post, it really isn't as good as events on Facebook, but can have some gems every now and then, take a look. 

3. Tinder. I haven't necessarily had anything blossom from this.. however my match list is loooooong. Lol, I am a little outgoing so I usually meet outside of apps. However this is a really good place as long as you set your intentions on your profile. The best thing is having someone with you that speaks the local language and is also a good friend. 

4. Bumble, like tinder but I actually liked it more. A looooot less people though.

5. Local bars/clubs. If you like to dance and just like to mingle, can have a lot of fun meeting new people.(buy someone a drink, but not in a creepy way but as a friend)

6. Find someone who is also working on their laptop and give a nice introduction, ask them what they do and let them know it's awesome they are doing what they are. Met good friends this way.

7. Join local Facebook groups. Ask some questions. Usually there is a digital nomad group as well if it's anything like Thailand. 

I'm not gonna give inspiration like be adventurous and fearless because that's just mindset not a roadmap. Gotta have both. But the map and plan is always better. So do some research get to know people and above all... Just be yourself. People who are trying to hard to impress are hard to be around. Down to earth, normal peeps are the way.

solotravel,"Hi everyone, 
Please can you help me create a budget for around 3-4 months in SEA, I’ll outline a few factors to consider below:

I’m taking the usual route of SEA:
- Gili Trawangan
- Bali 
- Singapore
- Malaysia
- Thailand 
- Cambodia
- Vietnam 

Experiences i definetely want to see:

Singapore Grand Prix - £322 (Premier Walkabout) 

Visit Elephant Jungle Sanctuary £57

Open Water Dive in Gili Trawangan £305 

(Not thought about other experiences yet as will mostly decide what I want to do when I get there) 

Accommodation: 

Hostels but now and again I intend to treat myself to a hotel room to rest and just to switch it up 

Food and Drink:

I intend to eat mostly local food whilst I’m away and obviously treat myself to the odd burger/junk food now and again

Drinking booze is a tricky one because I can only see myself going out to bars when I’m in a big city. If I’m on an island or in a rural area, I can’t see myself going to bars much but I could be wrong. With that said, when I do go out, I will most likely buy cheap booze from the shop and socially lubricate myself in the hostel beforehand 

Travel:
Travel expenses accumulate to roughly: 
£1,200

That’s including my flights there and back, cheap long bus journeys and the occasional odd flight (if the bus alternative is 10+ hours) 

I think that’s about everything, if I’ve missed other factors to consider then please let me know!

solotravel,"*Budget:*

£110

*Trip Length:*

Three days from Tuesday morning to Thursday evening

*Destination(s):*

Astrakhan, Elista, Volgograd

*Accommodation:*

I stayed a 3\* hotel in Elista for £12 the first night, whereas I opted for a small apartment for £8 which I booked via Airbnb for the second night in Volgograd.

*Activities:*

I went there to vlog so I was all the time walking around and filming. I did buy a small souvenir for my collection in each city. I flew from Moscow to Astrakhan on Tuesday, spent a a few hours there walking around and visiting the Kremlin and the Volga (this is where the longest river in Europe flows out into the Caspian Sea). I then headed to the bus station and jumped on a bus, which crossed the desert of southern Russia into Kalmykia, the only Buddhist republic in Europe. Here the next day I walked around and visited a few Buddhist temples, before again taking a bus to Volgograd. I visited the Stalingrad Battle museum and went to the outskirts of the city to see the largest statue of a woman in the world, the Motherland Calls Statue.

*What Went Right:*

I stayed well within my budget, and I met many interesting people in Elista and Volgograd! Kalmykia, of which Elista was the capital, was so interesting. I managed to make my way around these off-the-beaten-path destinations without any major issue.

*What Went Wrong:*

I got approached by two people in Astrakhan who were insisting on touching my camera and belongings, and I was able to brush them off only after buying them a coffee. Not the best start to the day. My original bus ride from Elista to Volgograd was also cancelled, and I had some difficulty buying another ticket for the same day, and the new bus was a downgrade from what I had originally bought.

*Recommendations:*

Do not attempt this trip without speaking a bit of Russian or with Russian travel companions. It's not like it might necessarily be dangerous, but you'll just have a hard time going around.

*Final Verdict:*

Awesome! Volgograd was the best out of three for its history, I enjoyed Elista so much for its culture, I had a bad impression of Astrakhan but I am aware it was mostly because of the bad encounters I had, and that can happen everywhere of course.

solotravel,"I’ve been thinking about planning a short trip to Australia for 2022 (hopefully travel will be safe &amp; open by then). The problem is that I just don’t really have anyone in my life with the means &amp; desire to travel that I have right now, and I don’t want to wait for them to catch up. I want to see the world while I’m young. My concern about traveling alone is safety of course, but also I’m afraid I would be bored and it wouldn’t be worth going. I’m by no means a social butterfly, I’m afraid if I go by myself I’ll just sit in my hotel room, maybe visit some coffee shops alone and call it a week. My question is, how easy is it to meet people on a short trip? If you went on a short trip alone, did you have fun? Any advice for putting myself in highly social situations (where I might meet other travelers to hang out with) is appreciated :)

solotravel,"As anyone who travels know, hostels are an amazing source of friends, information, social activities and cheap accommodation on the road for the solo traveler. Many long term RTW backpacking trips would be next to impossible but for hostels.

Hostels however tend to lean heavily into the early twentysomething age demographic, with only a scattering of people over (and under) that age bracket staying in one. Anecdotally, from 25 years of staying in over a hundred of them myself, all over the world, I tend to find they're populated by *roughly* 5 percent under 20's (and families), 70 or so percent people in their 20's, roughly 10 percent 30 somethings, and 5 percent of guests being 40 plus.

I travel every 5 years or so, and I've certainly noticed that as I've gotten older, its gotten gradually more and more 'weird'. Twenties were fine, thirties less so, and you can often feel invisible or even encounter occasional outright hostility in your 40's (while being accepted at other times).

A recent thread about hostels and older travelers provided many mixed views about the 'creepy old person' in the hostel stereotype, with some people being firmly of the view that past 35 or so, you have no place in most hostels (and indeed this is the reason many Hostels set a maximum age limit at this figure).

Some people on the other hand were oblivious to the hostility many 'older' backpackers face in hostels by people that hold such views ('hostels are only for the young'). Others were fine with travelers of all ages, and saw no problem themselves crashing in a hostel at 45+ and shared stories about middle aged and older backapckers they met in hostels that were amazing  people.

It got me thinking - lets hand it over to the floor - As a general rule, how old is too old to stay in a Hostel? Can you be too old?

A few years ago I decided to solotravel across India and met a really fun group of people and hung out with them for about a month. One of them was a girl from Poland who I had an instant connection with, and we grew more and more to like each other and developed some feelings but as with every travel, it does come to an end and we figured that was the end of that. Over time, we lost touch with every body else from that group but both of us kept in touch and would text or call often. We started to feel that what we had felt back then has never really disappeared and the desire to meet each other one day kept growing. We had planned to meet a year ago but due to the pandemic, the international borders were closed and we both had no choice but to accept the reality. For context: I'm an Indian citizen and she is Polish. We both decided at that point that trying to struggle with our feelings is difficult and getting our hopes up will only lead to disappointment as the pandemic was in full swing and restrictions were getting stricter with no end in sight. She wanted to distance herself from this and in an attempt to get over this, she started working longer and dating new people as it was more real and dealing with this was only hurting her. I accepted that, and buried myself in work and tried to move on. We lost touch for a while and thought that the other had moved on. But, few months later we both were in quarantine in our respective homes at the peak of covid and while catching up to what we've been doing, we lost ourselves in a conversation that lasted for the entire night. And it became clear, that we really wanted to give this a try and our feelings have not really diminished at all. We again decided that when our respective countries open up, and it's safer, we would meet each other and spend time together and work on it. But, week after week, there seems to be no end to the restrictions and the wait would get longer and longer. And, a month ago I received a heart-breaking news that her job wants her to move to a different country and it would be a foolish move not to take it, but that we would find it difficult to meet once she leaves. I want to support her in this and want her to pursue this great opportunity, and also believed we could meet before she leaves in April. But the restrictions in both our countries, again delayed any chances of that happening. Maybe we could meet in a 3rd country, or maybe we would wait another 3 years before I can be where she is now.

solotravel,"Hi!

I am planning on doing some extended remote work stays next year in various countries. Likely starting in Spain in May of 2022 for a 4-6 month stretch and then moving to somewhere else.

Currently when I travel for 2-3 weeks I just pay the roaming plans, I'm from Canada so it's basically 10$ a day extra whenever I use my phone and I still have unlimited data and text from home. Which is still expensive but it's doable (usually only $100-$150 for the trip to have my phone).

Has anyone found a better way to have consistent cell number during these long haul stays? I realize I can just get a new carrier in each city, but wondering if there are better ideas out there.",Cell Phone Plans For Long Term Stays?,"Hi!

solotravel,"I’d like to depart sometime by summer/fall or pretty much when things open up. 

I will start my travel adventure in Mexico, I like the cost that Mexico affords and they have such beautiful culture, food and beaches. I plan to stay in Mexico till the Visa runs out with monthly long visits in Mexico City, Oaxaca, Yucatán and maybe some other recommendations or pueblos.

I’d like to travel to Europe from there and hopefully be seasoned from the Mexico adventure. I’d like to start in Portugal and make my way to Spain and consecutively to France, Germany. I’d like to Travel around here till the Visa runs out and I plan to hopefully stay a month at each stop to take day trips around and explore the local region not only the city. 

Would appreciate any ideas for places to visit and stay at. Places to eat and food to try. Festivals or other events. Maybe places to meet up and socialize with other travelers. 

Basic itinerary so far would be something like this with 28 days per city/area. This is not at all rigid and I could always change it to less than a week at anyone destination but the idea is that Airbnb offers monthly discounts. So say for instance I am in Mexico City for a month at an Apartment. This allows me to take my time to explore the city but also other places around the city that may require nothing more than a day trip or over night stay. So the main stops or itinerary could go as follows. 

Guadalajara, Jalisco 
Mexico City
Cancun, Quintana Roo
Oaxaca, Oaxaca
(Other suggestions or recommendations either for main city to stop or places to visit around these other places)

Europe could go something like this...

Lisbon, Portugal 
Madrid, Spain
Barcelona, Spain
Paris, France?
Berlín or Frankfurt, Germany?


Lastly where should I visit after Europe? The reason I ask is just because I want to get away and just go find myself for a little bit if you will. Sounds so cheesy, really just want to have fun and see new places and explore new ventures/ideas. Get away for a long while.

Thank you for your ideas and input.

solotravel,"Hey all, as lockdown and travel restrictions look like they're not really ending any time soon, I am thinking of maybe doing a road trip once the Spring hits and it's a little nicer out. 

I live in NYC, and would likely want to keep it either East Coast or head towards the Midwest a bit. Ie- not looking to go all the way to CA or Montana or etc. 

I'm thinking even just a weeklong trip with a rented camper (just me) that has a decent sleep set up. 

For those who have done road trips before, what kind of vehicle is ideal for this, and how much would I expect to spend on rental? 

Also, would you rely on eating out, or would there be a way to bring some kind of simple cooking setup and actually doing meal prep for part of the trip?

Lastly, what spots or general itinerary would be good for someone who wants to focus on seeing outdoor/nature spaces during the day (nature preserves, nice parks, beaches maybe), and hopefully doing some stargazing at night?

I've never done a road trip, so what other questions should I be thinking of? Ie- how much to allot for gas if I rent, say a van? Where would I park it each night?

solotravel,"Hey everyone!

I have to tell you, the past few months have been a lot for me (the whole year actually) and I really want to take a huge break from college. My classes have been chill but the other aspects of college have been draining me. And so, I'm actually looking to take a leave of absence next Fall semester so that I can just take a break from friends and family. During this time period, I have decided that I would ideally want to cut off all connections with current close ones and hope to meet new people where I go. (I am willing to push my break as long as it needs to be pushed for Covid reasons.)

However, I do not know much about travelling in Europe or even which country I should go to. The reason I like the Nordic countries is because of their great health and social care and even more so due to their low levels of sex and racial inequality. I am looking for advice and recommendations for choosing a country and living in that country in general. If it helps, I have gone travelling to Canada (Toronto, Alberta, and Midland) and Belize (Corozal and Belize City) and I have loved both of the countries and acclimated well. I would be able to fit in in different places and cultures as I am very willing to adjust my lifestyle accordingly if that information is useful. I'm not picky about where I go as long as the people are friendly with fun things to do and nice places to go. Also, in terms of duration of stay, I would want this period to be about 3 months or less. I believe this will also help me not to have visa issues for staying too long. My ideal budget for this trip would be around 15 - 20k USD but I am willing to increase/decrease it as fit. Another side information I would like to add is I have a family friend in Sweden (Stockholm) that I could potentially reach out to for help, but I doubt he would be able to show me around for more than a day or two.

solotravel,"Hey, so as the title says I’m 23m and wondering if anyone here has experiences with camping solo in the Uk and Europe? When things start to open up for travel within the UK (summer hopefully), I’ve been looking at driving and camping around the southern coasts &amp; Scotland and then hoping to branch out to France and Spain later in the year. 

It would be just me and a small van and would look to stay on campsites mainly with the odd Air BnB stays too. 

Has anyone else done something similar and how did you find it? also curious if there was any others doing this along the way that you met — Still looking into this type of trip until long haul travel is allowed so any thoughts would be good!!

Has anyone else done something similar and how did you find it? also curious if there was any others doing this along the way that you met — Still looking into this type of trip until long haul travel is allowed so any thoughts would be good!!

solotravel,"5 years ago today, I was alone in Venice and found a cozy little restaurant for dinner with cool hand-sketched scenes of the city covering the walls. It was a chilly night and the place was mostly empty, so the owner was doing the serving himself and had stopped briefly a couple times to chat - especially after he noticed me singing quietly along with Billie Holiday while waiting for my food. At one point, a large group of wasted teenage girls crowded in frantically, seeking a bag for their friend to puke into. It was a chaotic and bizarre few minutes, but he obligingly provided a bag and managed (kindly) to get them to leave before she actually chucked. As soon as they were gone, he and I just looked at each other and cracked up, solidifying our bond. I was paying my check at closing time and he invited me to stay, saying that friends were on their way. So that's how I ended up hanging out for hours and drinking many bottles of prosecco with 4 Venetian restauranteurs who were full of stories about crazy celebrity customers and silly tourists. I wish I'd gotten a photo with them, but enjoy some of their wall art, and go visit if you're in Venice - Taverna Barababao!

solotravel,"As a way to keep myself sane, I’ve spent a lot of the last couple of months researching for a trip to Southeast Asia - hopefully in the not-too-distant future. I just have one pretty big concern: a majority of articles and blog posts I’ve read so far say that a scooter is more or less essential to making the most out of your trip. 

Sadly that isn’t really an option for me, since I don’t drive at home, and have a mild disability that heavily affects my coordination. So call me unadventurous, but I feel that the risks of riding a motorbike for the first time in SEA would heavily outweigh the rewards in my case. 

This hasn’t been a problem in most places I’ve travelled so far (mainly Europe and Japan), since it’s easy enough to get to most places by walking, cycling, public transport, ridesharing etc. I’m hoping these will still be an option in SEA, and I’m planning on joining a few tours to get to some more remote areas. But I’m still worried that those options won’t give me nearly as much freedom as my own set of motorised wheels, which could really limit my options of things to do – and even isolate me from fellow travellers. 

So, I’m curious if it’s really that unusual to travel in SEA without a scooter? Will it make it harder to make plans with other travellers?

While I was sitting there, a man walked up to my passenger door and tried to get in. I was parked near shops and businesses but no one else was around. Lucky for me, my passenger door was locked. He ran away after that.

solotravel,"Hi everyone, I've been mapping out future trip itineraries and I use Rome2rio a lot just for a rough idea on routes. Previously, there was a little ""+"" button to the right of the text box where after inputting the first two destinations you could add third, fourth and fifth destinations from there to plot out multiple points on a route.

I found this feature really handy. For example I'm planning on visiting the West side of Jeju island in a year or so when its safe and was figuring out a good driving route, however a few days ago when I tried to do it, it would only allow me to input 2 destinations, from A to B, and it wouldn't let me add additional destinations. That little ""+"" button that used to be there is gone now. Has anyone else noticed this or have I gone walnuts?

Let me know if you're still able to add multiple destinations to one map route, and if not, do you have any alternative sites I could use? Thank you!

lost my debit card, probably left it at the airport ATM on wednesday when i landed in Colombia.

Only have 60k COP to last me 8 days, which is literally nothing.

What is the fastest way to get money from my bank (bank of america)?

so far I've considered:

1)emergency debit card shipment, would probably get here Wednesday if they even would send it to my temp. air bnb address.

2) western union money transfer, which would take 0-4 business days through a bank, so Wednesday as well. Except at the western union office here they said you can only pick up cash with a govt. issued ID, not a bank account. even though the western union website says the passport is fine.

3)I've called every number at the airport in medellin and they don't answer. literally all day, not even the banks. So I will probably spend 20k COP to head back to the airport tomorrow on the offchance that the lost and found has it, or the bank which was right next to the atm.

please help haha. any other ways to get cash from my bank asap? I have btc as well. Id rather not starve till my flight out of here

2) western union money transfer, which would take 0-4 business days through a bank, so Wednesday as well. Except at the western union office here they said you can only pick up cash with a govt. issued ID, not a bank account. even though the western union website says the passport is fine.

3)I've called every number at the airport in medellin and they don't answer. literally all day, not even the banks. So I will probably spend 20k COP to head back to the airport tomorrow on the offchance that the lost and found has it, or the bank which was right next to the atm.

please help haha. any other ways to get cash from my bank asap? I have btc as well. Id rather not starve till my flight out of here

solotravel,"(Western Canada)

So like most travellers, I was pretty bummed when the world decided to fall off a cliff last year. I had plans of tackling the last inhabited continent on my bucket list and backpacking through Africa. 

The first month of the lockdown was fine, but the adventure bug started to bite. I decided to start converting my 4x4 vehicle (purchased for $2,800 CAD) into an overland vehicle. I built a bed in the back, put in an electric cooler, camping stove, water, safety equipment and roof rack. All in I built a bedroom on wheels for well under $5k. 

It was a different style of travel because I wasn't going to tourist attractions and meeting people so it took some getting used to. At first I just sort of drove around not really knowing what to do. I started with an overnight trip, then did a few days then ended up doing a month straight on the road. (I was off work for 4 months because of the pandemic).

I got into hiking in a big way and it started giving purpose to driving to new places. I bathed in lakes and rivers and cooked over the fire when I could. Being a couple of hours down a dirt road with no one around really gave a new meaning to solo travel.

I slept anywhere because I could just pull over, climb into the back and go to sleep. 

All in I drove about 15,000km and saw a bunch of places I never would have gone to before. 

I felt bad telling people what an amazing time I was having but it was really a cool new way to solo travel. I'm actually beyond excited for the summer so I can do it again. 

I'll post the video in the comments if anyone is interested.

I have done a reasonable amount of overseas travelling in the past including staying at hostels but i’ve always gone with a friend or family member and never solo.

I want to go spend a month in a different location specifically PNW/SW (plan below) starting in April until at least October.

Looking for dog friendly, with wifi (since I need to work), can be shared or private space.
Want to be able to hike (with dog), time to read, art, and cook.
Not looking to camp since will need wifi.

solotravel,"Hi r/solotravel 

I recently got vaccinated and am looking forward to my first post-vaccine trip. I normally like international travel, but that seems dicey with COVID going on so I figured I would see some of the US. I picked Arizona in March for my first trip. I have a rough idea of an itinerary, I would appreciate any advice you have. My plan so far is:

Day 1- Fly into Phoenix, get rental car, spend night near city 

Day 2- Drive to Organ Pipe National Monument, spend the day hiking and exploring, Drive to Tucson

Days 3-6- Use Tucson as a base, explore Southern Arizona, Saguaro NP, Mt. Lemmon, eat delicious Mexican food. On one of the days, travel to Nogales, Mexico for Dental work- the border is still open for medical travel.

Day 7-8- Drive to Sedona, stay there two nights, hike around the area.

Day 9-10- Grand Canyon- I reserved a lodge in the park. This is the only part of the trip that is 100% locked in, had to lockdown what lodging was available.

Day 11- Drive to Phoenix, maybe see a little of the city depending on energy level spend the night before

Day 12- Fly back home.

Any thoughts or suggestions? 

Too much time in Tucson? I have 4 nights there on this plan, I built in extra time because I am going to lose one day going to the dentist in Mexico- doing this will help offset the cost of the trip. I could spend a night in Ajo near organ pipe, or do an extra night in Sedona instead.

solotravel,"M25. Planning a solo trip, maybe later this year- during October or November(Assuming covid will be in control)

I can fly on Thursday and stay until next Sunday.(10 days)

My planned itinerary is as below.

Friday Saturday Sunday - Berlin

Monday Tuesday - Prague

Wednesday Thursday - Vienna

Friday Saturday - Budapest

Sunday leave from Budapest on my return flight.

Are the days I have assigned enough for these cities.

I get very limited number of vacations so 5-6 days per city is off the limits for me.

At the most I can cut out one city (Vienna or Budapest) from my list above and assign those days to somewhere else.

How do you all think about this itinerary?

Any inputs/suggestions are appreciated!

Thanks.",Berlin-Prague-Vienna-Budapest,"M25. Planning a solo trip, maybe later this year- during October or November(Assuming covid will be in control)

I can fly on Thursday and stay until next Sunday.(10 days)

My planned itinerary is as below.

Friday Saturday Sunday - Berlin

Monday Tuesday - Prague

Wednesday Thursday - Vienna

Friday Saturday - Budapest

Sunday leave from Budapest on my return flight.

Are the days I have assigned enough for these cities.

I get very limited number of vacations so 5-6 days per city is off the limits for me.

At the most I can cut out one city (Vienna or Budapest) from my list above and assign those days to somewhere else.

How do you all think about this itinerary?

solotravel,"Hi r/solotravel,


I have done my fair bit of travelling to now understand that some countries are just . . . Not nice. 


However, in my personal experience, I cannot ever say I did not like a country or culture as I instantly get labelled all sorts of things.


Thus, when I watch Youtube travellers always always always love every single country, every single culture and every type of food - I know that behind the camera some think otherwise. 


Thus, getting to my point, ya'll know any honest people I can follow on youtube that make travelling vlogs?

Thanks


EDIT/UPDATE:
Due to the very high response this post got, it is obvious that many people feel the same - in that they cannot voice their honest opinions on certain countries/cultures/places as the world is not yet ready for it. 
To everyone who has given me recommendations, I hugely appreciate it. I will be subscribing to each and check them out.

solotravel,"Quarter Life Crisis/Boredom

I am a 30-some odd single woman with two lazy cats. I have lived in the Appalachia my entire life. It is beautiful here, but I. Am. Bored. 

I began solo traveling about six years ago, just to cities where I knew people. I make the trips as often as I can, and over time it has solidified the notion that I want to leave. There is so much more out there, so many new people, so many new beers, legal medicine that won’t eat my brain cells, new sceneries, new everything! I yearn for new. 

I am financially sound and have zero strings keeping me here (aside from working for a decent company who pays for my health insurance). I have been doing research and trying to make concrete connections with people I know (internet or irl) for the past three years. Obviously, the “comfort bubble” and free health insurance are what have hindered me. 

I am ready to do it. But... HOW? What did you or those you know do? Did they have connections, job or housing wise? 

Preferably, I would know at least someone, and they’d have a spare room available, to help lower the initial financial blow and familiarity. I would also prefer to fly to X city and land a job before the move. Are these steps truly crucial? I met a guy a few years ago who does what I want to do for a living... travels to a new city, on a whim, but with only a few hundred saved - not a few thousand, lands a job, lives there for a year, and is on to the next one. I do not know how one does this. 

I visit Denver more than anywhere else and fell in love with the city, but it is just excruciatingly expensive. I put Craigslist ads out there and neighboring cities last year and received a ton of responses, but couldn’t find anything close to what I pay now. I’ve always wanted to live in Oregon, because mountains + coast, but from the ads I set out there, I was told I’d have to live in the city in order to have a job, which to me defeats the purpose of living in Oregon, but it isn’t out of my realm. NorCal, same reasons, but expensive, and Murder Mountain. I’ve visited Florida every year of my life and would not mind a nice, quiet place there. I have a friend who moved to Hawaii a year and a half ago, we often joke about me moving there. It would be a very expensive, drastic move. 

I have decades of experience in the service industry and am not opposed to continuing that, I feel it’d be an easy segue into a new city. I’m also not opposed to jumping to Plan D and just being a drunk on the beach who sells surfboards or bartends, living in a little shack. 

(I think at this point it’s safe to say, I want to live by the beach)

Please help! I don’t want to waste any more of my life somewhere I am not happy. *inb4 “moving won’t make you happy;” change is necessary for growth, and even though change may not make me happy, monotony certainly does not.*

I would love to have my trips documented, to show my children in the future, but i really don't like taking pictures/videos/writing because it feels like a burden to me. I know a lot of people enjoy creating content, but unfortunately i wasn't born like that :(

I don't have any friends that are good content creators either, and even if i did i guess that (1) it would have to be a really close friend, one that would enjoy spend a lot of time with me traveling, and (2) would have to have no responsibilities or job but still have money.

So i guess what I'm asking is, is there a solution to this? Or do i just have to accept that my travels won't be documented?

Thanks to everyone for reading!Kind of a weird question",hey guy work lot travel littl bit last year mayb two three year retir lot money travel wherev want go would love trip document show children futur realli like take pictur video write feel like burden know lot peopl enjoy creat content unfortun born like friend good content creator either even guess would realli close friend one would enjoy spend lot time travel would respons job still money guess ask solut accept travel document thank everyon read kind weird question,1

So this question has been stuck in my head for months now. After traveling for most of my life, I think I can't stop. But I have been thinking about my next step in life.

I turned 40 last year. No kids. No significant other. Just parents who are up there in age. Once they pass, there will be nothing to hold me back. I can pretty much just go. Live anywhere in the world.

Once that happens, I have thought about just selling everything and working for NGO's. I already give a lot. But I feel like I could give more. I want to do more. I don't have specialized training. I do not have a college degree that would be helpful to a NGO. But I have enough skills that would be helpful to a group. Or multiple groups. 

I'd love to get some advise from people who Solo travel and volunteer. Not workaway types of work. But true nonprofit work. Once I take off, I plan to keep going for the rest of my life. I would like to build my skill level up so I am more valuable to them once I go. I would also love to know about some solo trips I can make to get myself accustomed to non profit work as a solo traveler.

solotravel,"Well, like most of you I haven't really been anywhere in a year. The most exotic places I've gone since covid broke out? Upstate New York and Eastern Pennsylvania. Both times just to hit up a few hikes. I'm from New Jersey. The said travel I'm going to describe was from March 7-10 of last year (things really started to get ugly about a week after this and I hurried back home). I saw something that reminded me about Chiloe Island, and I want to describe it more in-depth. This was going to be part of a 4-5 month-long trip through South America that got cut short 5 weeks into it by Ms. Rona. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/fnsloo/5_weeks_in_patagonia_trip_report/) is my report of the 5 weeks.

Now where is Chiloe? It's that sort of [oval-ish island](https://imgur.com/xYqGzE8) west off the coat of south-central Chile. Chile has a lot of islands sprinkled off its west coast, but most are uninhabited places that no one visits. Chiloe is cut off from the rest of Chile and as a result, they've established really neat culture and traditions of their own. The Spanish tried to come and convert the natives and as a result, Chiloe is famous for its charming wooden Jesuit churches throughout the island.

**Budget**: It's hard to say exactly. My estimate from looking back at my trip notes is:

$14 for the hostel\*3

$15 for the ferry from the mainland

$7 a day on average for the small buses around the island

$10ish for the bus out

$10ish for the penguin tour

A few dollars on national park fees

About $25 a day on food averaged out. I had 2 sort of upscale meals; if you're going to Patagonia though this is the place you want to spend big on food.

So $150 about, a little more for 2 full days and 2 half days. What's that, $35-40 a day? 

**Trip Length**: 2 full days and 2 half days, I could have pretty easily done more. Not sure why I left early.

**Destination(s)**: I stayed the entire time in Castro, which is the hub of the island. It's a gritty city that can be a little unkempt for sure around parts, but it's not without its charms.

**Accommodation**: Stayed at La Minga hostel. Clean place with a nice vibe and friendly owner. Decent enough location. Sadly, and I hate saying this but who knows how many hostels will still be around after this is all over :(

**Getting There and Around:** There is a ferry that runs from Chaiten I believe twice a week early in the morning, one of the days being Saturday. There are buses frequently going into the island from Puerto Montt if you're coming from the north, but you might have to go to Puerto Montt to connect if you don't have the time in your schedule to wait for the ferry. The collectivos and ferries connecting the towns of the island are cheap and plentiful. You won't have to wait long to find one to get to where you need to go, and you won't have to pay more than $2 for any of them.

**Activities**: Looking at the notes I kept on my phone

**Day 1**: Took the ferry from Chaiten to Chiloe and it was about 4 hours. Arrived in Castro and walked around, looking at the palafitos (stilted wooden houses) and the famous St. Francisco wood church in the square. I had an early dinner that was fantastic of fish stew with a confit of cottage cheese. 

**Day 2:** I decided to do some island hopping. I first stopped in Dalcahue, which is a super pleasant fishing village. This was on. a Sunday and they have a market every week, so I walked around the market and bought some arts and crafts. I walked around the promenade and watched the boats and fishermen selling their goods. I bought fresh oysters from a fish monger that I ate for lunch. I then took a ferry to Achao on Isla Quinchoa. This is a secluded town with a nice beach and wooden chruch - I had a cup of tea on the water.  Then I went to Chomchi to look at the church there which isn't the nicest town - it started raining and I headed back to Castro

I had the quintessential Chiloe dinner of Curanto - mussels, horse mussels, shellfish, broth, clams, potato, potato bread, and sausage cooked on hot pebbles (I took one of the pebbles home as a souvenir).

**Day 3:** Decided to go to Ancud, which is sort of the second biggest town on the island. It is on the north tip. Ancud has a nice waterfront with cannons and a fortress. It was one of the last Spanish strongholds during the war of Independence. I checked out a local food market which had all kinds of strange fish and wasn't the most sanitary place. Then, I went on a tour for several hours - Ancud is where you go on tours of the Magellanic penguin colony. The guide took my group to some excellent viewpoints. On the boat tour I saw penguins and a seal resting on the rocks. I had a fish dinner in Ancud and decided to watch the sunset from the fortress up on the hill, where the local teenagers hang out. I think I saw some sort of protest there for international women's day maybe?

**Day 4:** I got up and went to Chiloe national park, which is the natural crown jewel of the place. The park was a small area with a bunch of well connected and nice short trails. It was kind of rainforest-y but also had beach biomes with great views of the ocean, and a lake. I sat on the sand dunes and read for hours. I probably fell asleep even for a little while. I then got back to Castro and took the bus to Puerto Varas (another lovely place). 

**What Went Right**: Almost everything - it's a really lovely part of Patagonia that isn't talked about as much as say, Torres Del Paine or El Chalten or Pucon. Those places are great of course, but Chiloe is unique. It provides the natural beauty of Patagonia along with unique local culture, excellent food, charming churches, and charming markets.

**What Went Wrong**: I may have stayed in Ancud; it's nicer than Castro imo. However, Castro is much better located for exploring the island. Otherwise, I would have spent longer on Castro and seen Tantauco National Park, which many recommended. It can get rainy and it got hard at times because I don't speak Spanish (the penguin tour was all in Spanish for example) but these are general problems you encounter in a lot of Patagonia.

**Restaurants:** I have joined the dark side of vegetarians since this trip. If you are a meat eater though, the seafood is fucking out of this world and you have to eat it. A couple of restaurants: 

Restaurant Nueva Galicia - This was the upper scale one with the Curanto. Castro

Restaurant Travesia - A very charming little place where I had the cottage cheese and fish stew. Castro

**Final Verdict**: Definitely make it part of your trip to Patagonia - to beat a dead horse, Patagonia is amazing but even within Patagonia Chiloe is pretty unique.",Trip Report: A Plug for Chiloe Island,"Well, like most of you I haven't really been anywhere in a year.

solotravel,"A bit of background: I finished my BSc at the end of 2017, then spent 2018 to early 2020 travelling. I did some typical gap year things like volunteering, backpacking, and au pairing. My favourite experience by far was the year I spent in Vietnam as an English teacher. I decided (pre covid) that I’d quite like to spend the rest of my 20s/early 30s teaching English in Asia with maybe a few breaks between contracts to backpack in other parts of the world.

I wasn’t bothered at all about using my degree as I figured when I did want to settle down I would move back to my home country (New Zealand) and do a masters degree as my ‘entry point’ to starting a career. Anyway, then covid happened and I’ve found myself back in New Zealand doing the masters degree I thought I was going to do in 8-10 years time. 

I’m glad I’m doing it as it is an interesting degree and while not being able to travel it’s nice to feel as though I’m working towards something. The problem is the timing just feels really off. I always thought I would do my masters when I was serious about staring a career. If it were possible I would much rather be travelling right now. When I finish this degree I know I’m going to feel torn between using it to get a decent job here in NZ vs going back to Asia and doing something I like but it still not using my degree. I don’t know how to explain it, my mind is a muddle. 

TLDR: I’m worried that if I go back to long term travel and don’t use my degree, it will be hard to start a career in my field once I come eventually come back to New Zealand. I’ve never had a job related to my degree before so would be trying to start a career a long time after studying with no relevant experience. Is anyone else in a similar boat?

solotravel,"Hey guys!

What are some interesting places in Spain that I should (try) and visit over the summer. I have lived here for 3 years and I have already visited most of the more popular places in Spain (almost all major cities and big towns) and now I am looking for ideas that are a little more off the beaten path, or completely unknown.

I have a little YouTube channel and I recently got a new camera that I would like to take and explore some hidden gems and make some cool videos over the summer.

I am not particularly interested in just visiting old towns, pretty things or going out in nature as this will happen naturally, I want to know about some specific areas that have unique people, events, monuments, histories, etc etc. I understand that some festivals or events may not be possible to see this year, but maybe for summer 2022.

These are some examples of the places or things that I am interested in, so that you have an idea for the type of thing I am seeking

\- Benzú (small Moroccan village in Ceuta) charming place next to the border, I've been there before

\- Castrillo de Murcia (Burgos) to see El Colacho, where people jump over babies

\- Restaurante del Diablo (Lanzarote) a restaurant that cooks with an active volcano

\- Kaos Temple (Llanera) a church converted into a skatepark

etc etc, so things like these. Not really tourist attractions but more places that are of cultural or niche interest

What are some interesting places in Spain that I should (try) and visit over the summer. I have lived here for 3 years and I have already visited most of the more popular places in Spain (almost all major cities and big towns) and now I am looking for ideas that are a little more off the beaten path, or completely unknown.

solotravel,"This may be an odd question but, have any of you ever prioritized travel for leisure/pleasure over your potential career?

In my specific situation, I have an opportunity to go work in conservation in Oregon (a place I have wanted to live for quite awhile, but have been putting off so I can save money and travel - a semi-moot point with COVID going on). The jobs that I am getting offered are temporary and last from late April to mid October, 2021. 

The  problem is that I have also applied to an 7-month english teaching program in France with a set start date of October 1, 2021. If I accept one of these temporary jobs, it will look great on my resume and I will be able to live in a beautiful place. The downside is that I will be turning down the job in France, which is something that I have been wanting to do for the past few years and will allow me to travel (hopefully) in late 2021-spring 2022 but won't necessarily advance my career. 

I'm not sure how things will look in France in October with COVID, but obviously I don't have a magic ball to tell me the correct thing to do, so I turn to you all for advice.

**Folk Wisdom**: Speak the local language and you will be treated very well.

These seems to be true but more so in some countries like France than in others.

**Actual experience**: My Mexican-American friend went to Spain(a bunch of cities) and he told me that when he spoke Spanish people gave him a ""cold shoulder.""  Or even thought of him as somewhat ""lowley' since he had a different accent. Its very likely that Spanish people thought of him as a Latin American living in Spain.

In contrast, when he  highlighted his 'Americaness', spoke in English, and said he was from  the West Coast in America. People would treat him way better. He was put in the 'Rich Anglo"" box alongside Americans and Brits. Regardless of his skin color.

I've also seen African and minority Americans telling me about analogous experiences in which being American and speaking English fluently set them apart from other people of African or Indigenous descent. It seems that in certain societies being an English speaking America, regardless of skin color is a big advantage.

I managed to get away onto the street and eventually found a police officer. The police were very kind to me and got an interpreter, who was also very kind.

We went to the hospital, where I had all of the tests and they also gave me anti viral drugs for free.

Since then we have split and I am still dying to go, none of my friends are able so I am left entertaining the idea of finally pulling the trigger and doing it solo. I am thinking of March/April for a week (Saturday to Saturday). I have an idea of what I want to do, but wanted to get some input from anyone who has done a trip like this.

So I will get into the ideas of where I wanted to visit below but I was hoping on some input on which places I should decide on or if I left anything out that I have to see. After doing a bit of research I have realized I am going to have to decide on either the Pacific or Caribbean coast for my trip, so I need some advice there. Also, I would appreciate just any tips in general!

Places/activities I had in mind: Arenal Volcano, Puerto Viejo, Quepos, Manuel Antonio, Santa Teresa, Tamarindo, Rafting, Hiking, visiting ruins, ziplining, exploring the jungle, beach lounging/beach bar hopping.

I am interested in going somewhere with some nightlife but that is not my main goal, I want to spend about equal time beach lounging and drinking as hiking and experiencing the jungles, if not maybe 60% of my time experiencing the jungles and doing activities. Also I can afford to either stay in Airbnb's, hotels or hostels. I am leaning towards hostels just to have the opportunity to make friends and not be totally on my lonesome, but also have seen some really cool Airbnb's so I am open to both.

solotravel,"I came across some people here in this Sub that talked about how much they loved the priority pass, how they could relax in lounges and how they have some sort of a membership that allows them to upgrade or have access to reduced hotel prices, specials and tours.

Honestly when I am at the airport, i go see where my departure gate is, but will have a drink, some food or whatever and end up maybe 20 min before departure at the gate - normally i'd be one of the last people to board and feel i make good use of the waiting time.

Skipping everyone and sit in the plane for an hour longer actually doesn't make sense in my mind. Why would you want to sit even longer than necessary in that plane? Especially when you travel economy anyway?

I also plan my flights so either my stop-over time is minimal or i plan a day-pass and have some local food. As i'll have accomodation, i can freshen up and sleep properly.

I don't really see the advantages to wait in a lounge, other than it might be more private or some gimmicks you don't need. Depending on the lounge i know there is a buffet and free drinks. Looking on how much Lounge access costs, it doesn't seem a great value.

Regarding upgrades i sometimes ask the staff after departure and might just be upgraded for a few dollars or even for free.

I looked up the hotels that offer those reduced prices and honestly, they aren't that great, even for the reduced price.

Maybe my way of travelling or my personality simply don't ""need"" all that but maybe i am missing something here.

I don't really see the advantages to wait in a lounge, other than it might be more private or some gimmicks you don't need. Depending on the lounge i know there is a buffet and free drinks. Looking on how much Lounge access costs, it doesn't seem a great value.

Regarding upgrades i sometimes ask the staff after departure and might just be upgraded for a few dollars or even for free.

I looked up the hotels that offer those reduced prices and honestly, they aren't that great, even for the reduced price.

Maybe my way of travelling or my personality simply don't ""need"" all that but maybe i am missing something here.

I've been planning a 12+ month backpacking trip, with plans to leave in October of this year, Covid permitting.

Original Plan was to leave in October to backpack through India for 3 months. From there I would fly home for 1 month for a family wedding. And then leave for Europe for 3 months before flying to South East Asia for the last 6 months of my trip.

I prefer taking these things on spontaneously but, unfortunately it looks like I'm only going to get roughly 3 weeks off to do it so while St. Petersburg - Beijing will be tight, I'm looking at the following stop points:

* (Overnight train)

* Ulaanbaatar: 3 nights - 2 of them preferably away from Ulaanbaatar and in a Ger.

* (Overnight train)

* Beijing: 3 nights.

That is 15 nights in cities with c.6/7 nights on trains depending on schedules.

I might be travelling with friends so instead I was thinking of AirBnBing or renting a small space in Listvyanka just to be by the water.

TL;DR: here in the UK, we have one of the fastest vaccine rollouts worldwide and researchers have noticed a steep decline in new covid cases since the rollout. There isn't clear evidence that the vaccine stops transmission yet, but we will likely have evidence in a few months.

I want to hear people's opinions on this and - hypothetically speaking - if the vaccine is proven to stop transmission, how will this affect international travel?

Personally I'm optimistic and I believe the vaccine does stop transmission, so I'm hoping for worldwide travel to resume in 2021 (probably around September ish).

Oaxaca (3/2n): Initially planned 2 days here, but found out a family friend lives here, so will stay longer. Definitely want to try all the foods and check out Hirve Agua. Will be catching the night bus to PE

Puerto Escondido (3d/2n): Not plans here, but have read it's a nice stop. Night bus to SC.

Campeche (1d/1n): Exploring the city

Merida (3d/3n): Supposedly has a decent food scene and decent free museums

Valladolid (2d/2n): Cenotes, not sure which and getting to Chichen Itza from here

Bacalar (2d/2n): nothing planned

Tulum (2d/2n): Tulum ruins, There is an interactive art center outside town I want to check out too, Gym fanatic so can't miss jungle gym, Cenotes as well but not sure which are worth it

Playa Del Carmen (2d/2n): Chill and party

Puerto Morales (1d/1n): day to relax and just explore the town, read it's pretty quaint and traditional

Cancun (3d/3n): Same as PDC

What are some not miss things to do at places like Merida, Bacalar, Campeche, San Cristobal, and Puerto Escondido? Anywhere I should spend less or more time?

Mexico City (4d/4n): City exploration, Teotihuacan, Parks, Markets, Lucha Libre Match lol.

Oaxaca (3/2n): Initially planned 2 days here, but found out a family friend lives here, so will stay longer. Definitely want to try all the foods and check out Hirve Agua. Will be catching the night bus to PE

Puerto Escondido (3d/2n): Not plans here, but have read it's a nice stop. Night bus to SC.

San Cristobal (2d/1n): Explore city and check out Arcotete Park caves. Night bus to Palenque

Palenque (2d/n): palenque ruins

Campeche (1d/1n): Exploring the city

Merida (3d/3n): Supposedly has a decent food scene and decent free museums

Valladolid (2d/2n): Cenotes, not sure which and getting to Chichen Itza from here

Bacalar (2d/2n): nothing planned

Tulum (2d/2n): Tulum ruins, There is an interactive art center outside town I want to check out too, Gym fanatic so can't miss jungle gym, Cenotes as well but not sure which are worth it

Playa Del Carmen (2d/2n): Chill and party

Puerto Morales (1d/1n): day to relax and just explore the town, read it's pretty quaint and traditional

Cancun (3d/3n): Same as PDC

What are some not miss things to do at places like Merida, Bacalar, Campeche, San Cristobal, and Puerto Escondido? Anywhere I should spend less or more time? I'm into sightseeing, trying new foods (Excited about Oaxaca), meeting people, nature, and anything particularly interesting. For places like Cancun and Playa, I'm not a diver, but planning to just chill and party if things are calmer Covid wise in May.

Also, I would like to get a tattoo at some point on my trip, any advice on that will be appreciated as well.1month Mexico Trip Itinerary",plan trip mexico april may day want eye input itinerari itinerari current budget k mexico citi n citi explor teotihuacan park market lucha libr match lol oaxaca n initi plan day found famili friend live stay longer definit want tri food check hirv agua catch night bu pe puerto escondido n plan read nice stop night bu sc san cristob n explor citi check arcotet park cave night bu palenqu palenqu n palenqu ruin campech n explor citi merida n supposedli decent food scene decent free museum valladolid n cenot sure get chichen itza bacalar n noth plan tulum n tulum ruin interact art center outsid town want check gym fanat miss jungl gym cenot well sure worth playa del carmen n chill parti puerto moral n day relax explor town read pretti quaint tradit cancun n pdc miss thing place like merida bacalar campech san cristob puerto escondido anywher spend less time sightse tri new food excit oaxaca meet peopl natur anyth particularli interest place like cancun playa diver plan chill parti thing calmer covid wise may also would like get tattoo point trip advic appreci well month mexico trip itinerari,1

So to give some context:  I work on-site in my job and do not have the ability to work remote. My job has become pretty strict in having people quarantine. I had a close contact in December and found out about 1 week after seeing this person. I told my company because I would feel guilty if anything happened and they said I needed to quarantine away from the company for two weeks even though my doctor said that if I didn't feel any symptoms after 1 week of seeing this person I should be fine. They are also requiring people to quarantine if they travel outside the state. 

Im just worried that once things start looking good to travel my job may keep the restricitions a little longer (maybe till end of 2021) and I may not be able to travel in 2021 because I can't afford quarantining for two weeks. I know people who work at different places and have kept quiet about their travels but this is a good job and I wouldn't want to risk losing it and I would feel bad if something happened and I was hiding it.

Has anybody had any similar worries?",Worried I may not be able to travel in 2021 due to job,"

solotravel,"2020 was literally a shitty, boring and awful year and I guess most of you people would agree with me on that. It's been almost a year now, not being able to travel anywhere. I had some beautiful plans for 2020 like Going to Turkey.

Was really curious about exploring places like Istanbul &amp; Cappadocia. It would've been my first Solo International trip. Although I come from very supportive family but solo travelling isn't a thing my parents supported me as getting on a plane alone, sharing a room with strangers and hanging out with them in a new place has never been part of my life and I wanted to experience all of those things missing from my life so for Turkey I did everything to convince them and finally they agreed for it. But thanks to Covid for Ruining everything.

Now it looks like things will get on track soon and I don't want to waste my another year without exploring and want get out of my comfort zone. So now I'm planning to travel solo to some good South or South East Asian country where I could Enjoy myself to the fullest, learn something new and experience everything in my life(like a part time vegabond😂). I'm trying to keep the travel cost as minimal as possible as most of young University students like us try to do.

I'm up for suggestions and incase anyone wish to join me feel free to drop a Text. Ps- I'm 22(M) in final year of University, can speak English and Spanish, Photography, Reading and Working out are some of my hobbies.

And here are some of my questions related to this post :-
1)What's the best country would you suggest in South Asia or South East Asia where I can enjoy to the fullest and also keep my travelling cost to minimal?(except China🙌🏻)
2) Things I should take care while planning for my solo trip?

-A durable tent
-First aid kit
-Water filter 
-15c° sleeping bag (I will be leaving at the start of the summer so I doubt I will need a warmer one for a while)

solotravel,"Hi everyone! 

I had cancelled my trip to Costa Rica in March of 2020 due to the onset of the pandemic. The airline had given me a voucher (my only option, because the flight was not cancelled by them) which expires this March. And I'm not sure if this part is useful info, but last month I contracted COVID and have tested positive for antibodies.

To be honest, I wouldn't mind waiting until the pandemic is over to use my voucher. I know that most places for tourism and socializing are closed, so traveling abroad right now wouldn't be as fun. I am also nervous about the fact that crime rates have risen in a lot of Central and South American countries due to the pandemic. However the airline doesn't seem to be giving me a choice.

I've traveled alone before, so at the very least I might be able to enjoy working remotely from a rental in Mexico with a beach view. So basically, I'm looking for any advice on either (a) where to go at this time (from US) if I had to use this voucher, or (b) what can I do or say to the airline to avoid traveling AND losing my money.

Any advice would be appreciated.

P.S. I've already tried asking for a cash return and for pushing back the expiration date (via WhatsApp), but was repeatedly denied. I'm also looking into their new policy - they will give a voucher to whoever books a flight before Feb 28th and cancels. I'm thinking if there's a way to do that just to transfer my voucher to another voucher valid for a year? :/",I have an airplane voucher that expires in March. Already got COVID.

solotravel,"I get asked this a lot. People find it weird how passionate I am about travel. It started to make me feel weird and that I am thinking the wrong way about life, making the wrong decisions, or missing something about the future that they see but I don't, and it's starting to worry me.

I get asked: ""What do you like about travel this much that you make it your main goal?"", ""Why do you travel now when you can spend that time advancing in your career? When you can maximize your potential in work now?"".

I get told: ""You're still young, focus on work now and you will travel as you want later"".

I see skepticism, disappointment, and judging in their eyes.

So much that I started questioning why I like traveling, and if following this passion without a direct ROI is the right decision. And if I should be ""more grown-up"".

In your opinion, why do we like traveling? What is it in traveling that is so appealing? What psychological needs does it fill? And is it wise to follow this passion and make it a significant goal in our lives over the typical traditional goals of making money, advancing careers, ""maximizing potential"", and killing ones-self over extreme workaholism?

FYI I am here to be helped and supported, not to be judged that my thinking is drifting or I am listening to such people. It gets hard when I am alone, the one outlier of everyone around, listening to all of the above in many variations all the time. I just need your logical reasoning and reassurance. Your support to make me feel that I am not completely alone or wrong or missing something.

Thank you. You will have a big impact on my life.

solotravel,"The general consensus on Reddit seems to be that that 2021 will likely be similar to 2020, and we won’t see international travel really start up again until next year. 

Honestly, I’m hoping to start traveling again this fall and I don’t think it’s unrealistic. All of this is from a US perspective, but we’ve been vaccinating so many people every single day. Most of my friends have already had their first dose (granted, they work in healthcare and teaching). The J&amp;J shot is also expected to be approved in the coming months and given that it only requires one dose and doesn’t need to be kept at such cold temps, it could be a real game changer. 

Obviously no one can see the future, but it’s been said that everyone in the US who wants a vaccine will have one by the end of summer. And even now, with the pandemic in full swing, there are plenty of loopholes and even plain open borders that are allowing people to travel. Between the widespread vaccinations and the fact that so many places across the world are eager for tourist dollars to return, I think there’s a very good chance I’ll be able to safely travel later this year.

1. I have about 5000 USD (7000NZD) to get me started at set up tor the first month or two in case I can’t find work. Do you think this is enough for emergencies and also flight home if necessary.
2. I think it would be really cool to work on a mountainside for a season. I have never been able to afford to do any winter sports but it would be great to do some sort of job on the slopes. Any recommendations would be appreciated.
3. My next question kind of ties into the previous. If I will be staying in 1 location perhaps on a mountainside for 6 months and then Auckland for 6 months should I buy a car? Is having a car just a reality of being in New Zealand? 
4.Is it realistic to support yourself living in Auckland or any other city living on minimum wage? 
5. I am a gay male so having a small gay scene would be nice! But still trying to stay on the broke budgeters wallet

After Barcelona (possible 4 days there), I thought about spending some time on the French coast (I picked Collioure, which seems lovely, 3 days), I intended to go to Toulouse (with day trips), then San Sebastian (with day trips) and then as a final destination Madrid (possibly stay there for maybe a week, also including day trips).

solotravel,"I'm a teenager with dreams of traveling and backpacking around the world. I overplan my whole life and the idea of traveling kind of scares me because I feel like I'll be wasting time and setting myself back. I want to become a psychologist, which means I should probably get a p.h.d from a decent school. This will set me back a bit and I'll probably have to deal with debt even though I'll work through college. I also want to go on a mission because it's part of my religion. That lasts 18 months. So if I graduate highschool at 18, finish my mission at around 20, and then graduate with a bachelor's at 24. Then i'd want to go backpacking because I want to explore Asia,  sub-Saharan Africa and south and central america while I'm in my twenties and then go to other places when I'm older. By the way I don't expect to go to every country or anything but there's a lot I want to visit.

solotravel,"While traveling around the Asian part of the world, I have visited countless villages in many countries. This is definitely one of my favorite parts about traveling the world. 

I guess maybe it's because it is a group of tightly knit people who all rely on each other and everyone knows each other.  In addition to that, the majority of the time life is rather basic and simple. This is highly intriguing to me as I have grew up in modern society, like most of you who are reading this right now.

And I guess it is interesting to see the differences around the world, when it comes to living a basic lifestyle. Culture is usually very rich in these areas.

I am not sure which experience has been my absolute favorite, because they are usually all quite unique.  But this one was rather unuque:

While traveling along the western coast of Gujarat, India - visited a very small village right along the coastline with my Indian friend. The next town in any direction was about 10 kilometers away. This place was rather isolated.

As we walked along the coastline, I could see that there was some type of large celebration happening. We decided to approach the people (around 200 people).

As we got closer, I could see that people had noticed our presence. About one minute later, we were surrounded by a massive group who wanted to know everything about me. They have never seen a foreigner in their area before, like many places that I have visited.

After learning a bit about each other for about 20 minutes, everybody started asking for a selfie, so we organized one giant selfie during the sunset. The photo turned out amazing! 

There must have been 25 different children trying to ask me questions all at the exact same time. Unfortunately, I did not speak Hindi at that time (I can bit now)...so I was not able to understand them. My friend, who was with me could speak Hindi, but she was occupied by a couple of other people at the moment.

Soon later, the oldest man in the group invited us to his house for tea. 

As we walked to his house, half of the village followed us lol. The man kept telling the children to go away because they would not leave our side.

After we were escorted to his house, we had a cup of tea and we were asked a few more questions. 
It became dark rather quickly, and the man escorted us all the way back to our room, which was on the outskirts of this village (20 minute walk). He wanted to make sure that we got back safely.

Like in almost every village that I have visited before, the curiosity is very high among the locals, and the small acts of kindness / welcoming are just so fun to experience. The smiles are totally worth it!

I wouldn't recommend this type of thing to anyone who is shy. Literally, all eye balls and attention will be on you until the moment you leave lol.

I'm currently writing this as I am sitting next to the train tracks and a pond in the middle of a small village in southern India. I have been here for 1 year now waiting for flights to open again.

Anyway, is there anyone else out there who is addicted to visiting villages like I am? 🤔

To travelers who need a place, just to spend a night

I’m a lonesome nomad, looking to spend a night or two

Somewhere close to where you live, so I decide to write to you

&amp;#x200B;

Your profile looks reliable, you share a lot of information

About your job, your daily life, and that you live near the train station

There’s a smiling picture of your face, along with photos of your flat

So I start out my message with, “Dear stranger from the internet”

&amp;#x200B;

“Could I be so bold, to request a short stay

Just for a night or two, and I’ll be on my way

Could I be so bold to ask, to open up your home to me

And share a meal and spend some time, perhaps if you are free

And I hope I don’t ask for too much

When I request  to borrow a towel and such

I truly hope my message, won’t remain unread

Best regards, truly yours, a stranger from the internet”

&amp;#x200B;

We meet on your street and you insist, to carry all my stuff

I politely decline the offer, your hospitality is far enough

We enter your home and to break the ice

I ask “shoes off?” because the floors look real nice

As I put down my bag and leave my shoes on the mat

I get a warm welcoming hug, from the stranger from the internet

And for letting me drool on your pillow case

I might steal some shampoo too

But I will make a meal for you

I’ll cook some dinner, while you make my bed

It’s the least I can return, to this stranger from the internet

&amp;#x200B;

We share some stories of past travels, while I drink your wine

Could I pour myself another glass, or does that cross the line?

Can I get the wifi code, to make a couple of calls?

Does it invade your privacy, when I look at the photos on your walls?

You opened up your private home, your castle and your habitat

Just to provide help, to a stranger from the internet

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps we never meet again, or we made life long bond

When you request to stay with me, I promise to respond

Perhaps we were friends, or just roommates for a day

But when we meet again, I’ll try my best to repay

You don’t want nothing in return, but I’ll forever feel in debt

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps we never meet again, or we made life long bond

When you request to stay with me, I promise to respond

Perhaps we were friends, or just roommates for a day

But when we meet again, I’ll try my best to repay

You don’t want nothing in return, but I’ll forever feel in debt

solotravel,"A couple of years ago I had the choice of using the above funds for buying a home or just blowing it on years of travel. I earned that money myself saving every penny for 10years and doing ultra cheap travel which honestly was worth more than any expensive trip ever and really shaped who I am. I ultimately settled on a deposit for a home, as I had no family support if I had an emergency. I had already been to 60+ countries by then.

Fast forward to today, I have lost my career through no fault of my own and I am in negative equity. I should have just blown my money on years of travel or using it to learn a new language and settle somewhere new that I could really call home and have a nice simple life instead of a prison life in Western Europe. *c'est la vie.* I am OK with this and it is what it is.

solotravel,"Hi! So I traveled the US doing seasonal work for about two years and I've been wanting to go back to that life style. I've heard of the Australian work travel visa before but I don't think i was ever really in a position financially and mentally to go for it. The visa is only for those between 18-30 (for some reason?) and I am 27 so I am incredibly cognizant that I'm running out of time.

Has anyone ever traveled and lived in Australia with this visa? Do you have any tips or advice?

Once you actually get to Australia, how do  you find work/housing? I have extensive customer service, restaurant and office work experience.

Once my year is up, can I re apply and stay for one more year? If I do this, I'm gonna shoot for this coming summer at the earliest and next summer at the absolute latest. I only have until I'm 30 and i turn 28 in may of this year so I want to spend as much time as possible traveling on this visa

So I've just returned from a short solo trip. Had a ton of fun with people that were also solo, but found myself very struggling to socialize with already established groups, whether they came as a group or became one before I've met them.

Like if I'm not part of the inside jokes or stories, I get a hard time to open up and have fun. I'm suddenly shy and don't talk much, while when I'm part of a group that everyone is solo I'm very communicative and have a lot of fun.

Has anyone else experienced this? How are you dealing with it? How often does this situation really happens?

I want to continue my solo traveling after getting the vaccine (hopefully the first dose next week). Its very likely that I will find groups of people that came to travel together and I will be joining them (I know there are many groups from my country traveling there already).

solotravel,"I'll start. I got staph infection two weeks before my trip to Costa Rica. Didn't book a refundable flight or anything else refundable.

For anyone who's had staph infection, it was the worst pain of my life. I'll spare you the details but it was on the buttocks and I should have gone to the hospital, I was NOT OK. But I've seen a friend who got staph infection get cut open, drained, stuffed with gauze. He was recovering with a gaping hole in his calf from the surgery, stuffing it with cotton balls and waiting it out. I did not have time for a gaping butt wound, which would have surely taken more than two weeks to heal. And the American health care is expensive and I had already spent a lot of my extra funds on the trip.

 That being said I was coming down with a bad fever from the infection, leaking tons of fluids from the wound and taking so much ibuprofen for the pain and fever that my liver is probably permanently damaged. I decided to keep at it, cover the wound with medical honey 24/7 to keep it clean/open to be able to drain on my own and ultimately it healed enough to be closed about one day before my flight. 

There would have been no way I could have (1) lived with myself if I had risked infecting other people through all the water, pools and hot springs I planned to visit from my wound not healing, and (2) been able to swim risking infection and loss of buttock? or whatever happens if you infect a staph infection with other infections.

But I had a great time in Costa Rica!",What's The Most Savage or Stupid Thing You've Done To Make a Trip Happen,"I'll start. I got staph infection two weeks before my trip to Costa Rica. Didn't book a refundable flight or anything else refundable.

For anyone who's had staph infection, it was the worst pain of my life. I'll spare you the details but it was on the buttocks and I should have gone to the hospital, I was NOT OK. But I've seen a friend who got staph infection get cut open, drained, stuffed with gauze. He was recovering with a gaping hole in his calf from the surgery, stuffing it with cotton balls and waiting it out. I did not have time for a gaping butt wound, which would have surely taken more than two weeks to heal. And the American health care is expensive and I had already spent a lot of my extra funds on the trip.

 That being said I was coming down with a bad fever from the infection, leaking tons of fluids from the wound and taking so much ibuprofen for the pain and fever that my liver is probably permanently damaged. I decided to keep at it, cover the wound with medical honey 24/7 to keep it clean/open to be able to drain on my own and ultimately it healed enough to be closed about one day before my flight.

I'm an American seeking advice regarding border crossing in Europe. In March I'm looking to ride the Trans Euro Trail solo with a dual sport bike and intend to cross between multiple European countries! I'm seeing that each country has its own entry requirements, such as, an immediate COVID test, mandatory isolation for 10 days, ect.

Anyways, then COVID hit and here i am almost a year later sitting at my parents house doing nothing bumming around every day feeling sorry for myself and just waiting for things to hopefully return to normal 

Anyone relate? Any words of advice?

solotravel,"Story time: I was cycling in Brugge once with a crappy old bike I rented in one of the stores around this nice town and suddenly when I tried to mount the kerb as there was a car coming, since it had been raining that day and everything was slippy, the bike somewhat flipped and sent me on the deck and made a bit of a scene in what was a quiet back street. 

Luckily I did not get injured but the bike was f'ed up, the tyres were punctured and the bike chain came loose and out of the disc (sorry don't know the technical term). At that point I was just embarassed on the floor with the bike on top of me but then this guy came and fixed the bike chain, even though this was a messy job with all the bike grease etc, picked the bike up, said thanks and off he went.

Apart from having the nurse the bike back to the shop with a puncture all is well, got rescued since I had no clue how to fix the bike chain back.

Anyone have a similar good samaritan story, I'd love to hear it!

solotravel,"So I travelled to Thailand for 3 weeks after finishing uni and starting my new job. I completely fell in love and got bitten hard by the travel bug. Since then I've been saving for a dream trip.

My work place allows a years sabbatical after 2 years of working there, I like the security this provides and after a recent promotion I don't plan on leaving during covid. 

I plan on starting the trip on the 4th may 2022. 

Next is the list of places I'd like to visit and the duration I'd be thinking of staying there. I'm not setting everything in stone, giving myself between 4 and 5 weeks unplanned to just add randomly if I want to stay in a country longer for whatever reason.

6 weeks Australia

6 weeks Indonesia

3 weeks Malaysia (with 3 or 4 days in Singapore in the middle)

3 weeks Thailand

2 weeks Cambodia 

6 weeks Vietnam 

3 weeks Laos

Few days Thailand

3 weeks Philippines

6 weeks New Zealand

And finish it off with 7 weeks in Southern Africa (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia)

I think this tends to line up with the best times to visit, with Southern Africa finishing up the journey (the extra weeks will be used up before arriving, if it hasn't been used throughout the trip I may consider also travelling to Taiwan or Sri Lanka)

Does this seem like a good plan for my trip? 

Is this realistic?

As for budget I'm thinking I'd like to use £20k but could stretch to £25k if necessary.

Any advise or suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks very much.

solotravel,"Hi guys,

I am a guy who is 24 years old and currently study mechanical engineering. I have less then a year left before I get my bachelors degree and plan on taking a masters afterwards so I have roughly 3 years of schooling left. I recently moved from home and work part time saving maybe 200-300$/month and have 10 000$ in savings, with about 25 000$ student debt as of now. The education is tax-payed where I live so I am not taking huge losses over time. The interests are 0.05% and can pay it back however you want so I am not too concerned about debt but try to be smart about it.

The logical part of me is saying that I should continue to save my money and finish school, but for the last year or two I feel like my life has been really dull. I am single, sit in my apartment most of the time during corona and am constantly busy with school, work and chores. I kind of feel like I need to break the routine for awhile and do something I never done before and then return to school/work afterwards.

I have a real urge to travel around SEA for about 4-6 months as soon as the lockdowns are over and want to get your perspective for those who have experience with traveling.

I could probably rent out my apartment during that time to cover the rent, the only thing I am concerned about is that traveling will drain my savings. My plan is to save up additional money to cover 4-6 months of expenses for food and rent when I return. Other then that I won't have much left.

What do you guys think? Should I focus on finishing school first or take a break and go and travel? Another concern is that if I go traveling right after I am done with school I will have a harder time finding a job. I know that this question has been asked a million times but roughly how much would a travel like that cost?

Thanks.",Take a break from college and travel for 4-6 months around SEA?,"Hi guys,

First time traveling solo so looking for some advice. I work in tech and have been working from home for so long that I got to thinking I could do this from anywhere. Why stay in miserable, cold east coast. So I am taking the plunge and want to go spend an entire month (or maybe 3 weeks) to Puerto Rico. Looking for tips on where to stay and how to survive there

25 y.o single male. Gonna be working most of the days so need a solid internet connection for sure which is why I rejected hotels as they usually have unsecured internet which is no go for me. Which leaves me with Airbnb option only. I’m thinking of spending 2/3 of my time in San Juan because it’s a touristy area and I think it’s my best chance of survival through the initial anxiety of being in a new place. Then I plan to go to Rincon for the remainder of the trip

My interests are lying on the beach. Scuba diving. Surfing and basically any water related sports. Looking for advice on 

1) whether I should get a car for the entire duration of my stay or only after San Juan

2) What other parts of the island should I stay in/visit

3) how screwed I am if I am not fluent in Spanish

Main thoughts are I don't to go somewhere on my own and it full of groups of 18 - 21 year olds partying, but I'm still young enough and single that I want a vibrant place where I can go out and it be ok on your own. 

Length - 5 to 7 nights

Age group - 25 to 40

Budget - around 700-1000 preferably self catering as I could do some of my own cooking to save on meals out 

Interests:
Beach - Vibrant beach resort, fairly lively with a few good beach bars. Not a sleeper beach full of families and old couples

Cafes - Places to get a daytime drink on your own without it being weird, people watching

Nightlife - Up market bars and maybe the odd club, again places where being on your own wouldn't seem too weird, somewhere you can chill out and enjoy yourself with the possibility of meeting new people

Ideas:
- Greek Islands (not one's full of 18 year olds) 
- Spain and islands
- Italy
- Croatia
- Portugal
- South of France 
- Turkey
- Cyprus

solotravel,"This past summer I finally got fed up with COVID lockdowns and lack of travel. I saw a flight deal through Air Canada for a really good fare to Tokyo and jumped on it for a solo trip, assuming I could fill the 10ish day itinerary out later. I just got a series of emails that Air Canada has canceled some of the flights in my itinerary and one of the flights they've ""rebooked"" me on is scheduled to miss a connection (one flight arrives at 8:13 am but the next flight departs at 8:10 am). This new wrinkle, paired with the current state of things in Japan, mean this trip is likely shot.

Has anyone else had this happen? I'm primarily interested in how to approach the revised itinerary with a negative three minute layover. I realize that I could probably just cash this out for Air Canada vouchers but I'm wondering if there's another option that I could leverage into a fall 2021 Japan itinerary or other itinerary which would likely be significantly more expensive than what I booked for the spring.

This new wrinkle, paired with the current state of things in Japan, mean this trip is likely shot.

Has anyone else had this happen? I'm primarily interested in how to approach the revised itinerary with a negative three minute layover. I realize that I could probably just cash this out for Air Canada vouchers but I'm wondering if there's another option that I could leverage into a fall 2021 Japan itinerary or other itinerary which would likely be significantly more expensive than what I booked for the spring. Also, anyone else looking to travel to Japan this year and what are your itineraries and expectations for what will be open?

I want to take a break/leave my life for about 6 months at least, I’m currently in college but im more and more realizing that this isn’t for me, since I already changed my major once. I recently turned 23 and am nowhere near to finishing college and rather close to having a burn out. I dont feel right, stopped talking to my family for over a year even tho im still living at home. Can’t get out of my bed for weeks (more like months) and am just unhappy in general, can’t find any joy in anything. So the idea of leaving my current life in western europe for a couple of months and moving to a little apartment in the Mediterranean my family owns came to my mind. 

The biggest problem that occurs to me is: I need to start making money online without any real skills, 400-600 $/€ would be enough. But not with braindead jobs like surveys or anything. Does anyone a subreddit to post this in?

In my time off I thought about getting more in touch with the nature ( plants, etc) {subreddit?}

Start working out {subreddit?}

Read a lot of books to improve my mental and physical health and also my knowledge and maybe go into philosophical stuff {subreddit?}

There are so many more things in my head but since im close to burn out I can’t sort them and tend to lose my overview instantly, but I hope u got the idea of what I was trying to say so if anyone knows subreddits that could find, please let me know.

* **Flores**",southeast asia itinerary,"hello all! 

i have finalized, for the most part, my southeast asia itinerary and thought i would post it to get some feedback from you well travelled lot! i was considering going november 2021, but obviously will need to hold off and see what happens with COVID. if things aren't open, i'll likely push it back further as i want to be able to get the full experience without too much added stress. this is a very tentative plan, if i get to a place and don't like it or really love it, i'll probably adjust the trip. i just like to have some things planned in advance!

the bolded are the countries/cities i'm planning to visit, in parenthesis are my ideas on what to do once i get there! it ends kind of abruptly because i'm unsure where to stop exactly &amp; if i should add the phillipines in!

any advice on places i'm missing that are a must-see/what my budget should be/amount of time you think this would take would be very helpful! the indonesia part especially needs some work. thanks in advance.

solotravel,"To say Colombia exceeded my expectations would be a total understatement. I've divided it into places I went. At the bottom there's some more general information about traveling during COVID. These are just my observations but Colombians were super welcoming and happy to have tourists back in the country.

**Cartagena**

Awesome architecture and pretty murals in the old town. Heat is pretty intense however and the hassling from people desperate for tourists did get a bit much. Stayed in Casa del Puerzo. The location is slightly out of town which (due to the aforementioned heat) is more of a pain than it would be elsewhere. First guy I met in my dorm is a Redditor **from this sub** who had sent me a PM on my pre-trip post. First time that's ever happened! Ended up travelling with him in the machete/roadblocks/hot Colombian model story a bit further down...

**Santa Marta**

Loved it. Generally gets a bad rep from travellers but I'm at a loss as to why. Street food was awesome, people were way more relaxed than in Cartagena and it just felt a lot more Colombian. Also, is there a city in the world with better nature on its doorstep? World-class beaches, national parks, 'lost' cities, desert landscapes... Brilliant place. Stayed at [La Brisa Loca](https://www.labrisaloca.com/) here. Met some awesome people on their rooftop terrace. The music stopped at 11 pm but we just took in alcohol and got drunk all night. Having late-night salsa lessons with a couple of bottles of aguardiente and a group of Colombian flight attendants being a particular highlight. Good times.

**La Ciudad Perdida**

Great hike. I was in quite a small group (only 6 of us) but we all got on well. Landscape is impressive and the lost city itself is really beautiful. Being there at 7:30 am as the sun rose above the mountains with only 2 other people from my group and our guide was pretty fucking special. You do need a covid test before you go but you can get them for $10/15 at a clinic in Santa Marta. (20 minutes needed for the results).

**Riohacha**

Bit of a dead-end town but has a decent market on the promenade. Stayed at Nina kite. Staff were nice but no WiFi was a bit of a pain. Quintos may be a better option. This was the shoot off point for the desert.

**Cabo la vela**

Hired a driver/car to take us up. Desert landscapes were awesome but we did get stopped by multiple roadblocks (including a machete-wielding few). On the way back our tire burst and we were stuck in machete land for a couple of hours. Luckily we were travelling with THE hottest Colombian model, so could've been worse...

**Palomino**

Really quiet. Would've been cool pre-COVID but the place was pretty dead. [Dreamer hostel](https://www.thedreamer.com/palomino-hostel) is AWESOME for the price but it was probably one of the less decent stops in my trip.

**Costeño beach**

A great stretch of beach. More going on than in Palomino. Didn't do much here except get drunk and swim in the sea with the aforementioned Colombian flight attendants.

**Medellín**

Flew from Barranquilla - Medellín. $21. Stayed at [Los Patios](https://lospatioshb.com/). Great few days here where I mainly did the (excellent) graffiti tour, ate lots of empanadas, visited museums, had a few decent nights out. Also did a 1 night trip to Guatapé. Stayed in lake view hostel (recommended)

**Salento**

AWESOME. Stayed in Viajero. Really cool group of us there. Solo travellers from Israel/USA/Romania/Colombia/UK/France/Poland/Germany/Netherlands. Some really great people. Highlights included Valle de Corazón and a great coffee tour. Guide on the coffee tour got genuinely quite emotional when he was telling us about how much he wanted tourists to come back to the area. I promised to spread the word, so here I fulfill that! Finca La Arzacia is the name of the coffee farm. Definitely recommend it.

**Somewhere between Guatapé and El Peñol**

Travelled back to the outskirts of Guatapé with Pole/Dutch solo travellers. Stayed with a Colombian family here for a traditional Colombian Christmas. Seriously awesome few days swimming in the lake, eating freshly cooked bread/pizza/fish by the dad, kayaking and (many) beers in the evening with a whole range of people. Amazing. Definitely one of the highlights of the whole trip.

**Bogotá**

Flew from Medellín to Bogotá. [Cranky Croc Hostel](https://www.facebook.com/Cranky-Croc-265331993512831/) was awesome with lots of long term travellers  Met some great people through an international teachers FB group in Bogota as well as a great few tinder dates with a girl who showed me her awesome local neighborhood (Kennedy). Came to Bogotá expecting to like it less than Medellín but I actually REALLY liked it. I'm seriously considering moving here full time later this year.

**Calí + Buga**

Calí - not my favourite stop by a long shot, but I was there during a pretty heavy lockdown which (obviously) didn't help. People rave about the food but the (recommended) restaurants/street food I ate at were mediocre at best. Might be better non-COVID times (for the salsa) but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. Buga (nearby city) on the other hand was great! Holy water café did some of the best beer I've had in my life. My main regret in this area was not going to San Cipriano.

**San Andrés island**

There are dirt cheap flights from most cities in the country. I had heard seriously mixed things so was interested to see for myself. I did scuba diving here (first time) which was the definite highlight. $25 a dive. Guy was super chilled out when it came to any kind of rules but it was great fun. Did that twice there. Big recommendation would be to stay out of the main city (pretty awful place imo full of duty-free shops). República hostel is a good choice a little south of the main settlement. I really liked the 4 days I spent there. It is (quite a bit) more expensive than the mainland however.

**Back to the North coast (Costeño beach + El Río hostel)**

I headed back to the mainland and spent the last week staying first in El Río hostel (awesome location on the river near Tayrona) and Costeño beach hostel where there were some BIG parties. Met some super awesome people at both. El Río has a great location on, unsurprisingly, a river and due to there being no WiFi is really sociable. Recommend both very very highly.

**General observations**

1. Fewer international travellers but more domestic tourists. Despite that I was, pleasantly, surprised by the number of travellers there were staying in hostels. If you want to meet people, stay in the largest hostels. I generally prefer smaller hostels but these were really really dead. E.g. in Salento, there are perhaps better options than Viajero but that is where the most people were staying.
2. If you're single, it's **way** easier to pull. A mixture of a 5 month lockdown + less competition (for locals who prefer foreigners)
3. Some things are closed or need prior reservations so worth checking ahead with locals/social media.
4. On the whole, there was no need to book hostels but worth checking ahead if they're open.
5. Don't use Hostelworld/booking etc. There's no point + hostels really appreciate the extra income they get from you booking direct (this is the same post-COVID as well.)
6. BBVA is the best bank in Colombia for no ATM fees with international banks. If you see one, get money out! They're only really in the main cities so make the most of it.

**COVID tips**

1. If you are going to travel, appreciate there is a risk to you and the communities you visit. Wear a mask, wash hands regularly, take covid tests. (In 7 weeks, I took 3 tests) all of which were negative. Only one (for the lost city) was actually needed. If you are positive or have symptoms, isolate!
2. Download bumble/tinder and put in a bit of legwork before you go. Bumble actually worked better for me in Colombia - it's a great way to meet locals/other travellers (and especially so during COVID). I had some awesome, awesome, awesome dates.
3. I understand this post probably won't be popular but I had such a fantastic time. Colombians (and it's the same in the other great trips I've done during 2020) love having respectful tourists! I often hear from travellers older than me about the 'golden age' of travel in the early 2000s. Cheap tickets, discounts everywhere, fewer tourists, no pre-booking at hostels. It's just like now! People on this sub often write about how it's 'not worth travelling atm'. Trust me when I say this, it is.",Returned this morning from 7 weeks travelling around Colombia.

solotravel,"I (29F) was in the airport waiting to get on the plane for Bali and so many things were going through my head. I was terrified to travel across the world alone where I wouldn’t know another person for thousands of miles and I was scared to get picked up in the middle of the night in a foreign country by a stranger! I was even texting my sister about backing out after completely rearranging my life to follow this dream of mine.

But I knew I had to go. So I got on the plane, still terrified, eyes full of tears and I started my journey across the world and embarked on a trip that little did I know, would ultimately change my life forever✨🌍 ✈️

When I arrived at the airport, I discovered that my roommate who was going to be in the same program and was actually on the plane with me, so I didn't have to get in a car with a stranger alone at all...We actually became best friends, and that two months teaching English became the best two months I've ever had in my life.

What scares me now is the fact that I almost DIDN’T go. What TERRIFIES me now is the fact that I almost backed out and missed the opportunity of a lifetime. I will never let fear get in the way of my path and I strongly hope that you don’t either because you could be missing out on something that could end up being extremely pivotal in your journey of life 🦋✨

\*EDIT: I've had so many people reach out and want to know more about the volunteer program I went with. I am so eager to share because of the following:

1. My experience was so amazing that I wish everyone could experience it for themselves...

2. I am not an ambassador or anything for the company, but I know the founder/ the locals who work at the program and they are always looking for volunteers. It's such a good cause that I am happy to share about it.

If you would like to check out my instagram, Ann\_mariek- I have an awesome ""highlight"" that really captures my full volunteering experience. I know when I was researching for my trip, watching actually people's stories on Instagram was extremely helpful in deciding. Feel free to check it out and reach out with any questions :)

I am in line to receive my vaccine by February and if the indications in the coming months are that the vaccine is effective against spreading COVID, then I’ll feel comfortable making solid plans, but not until then. 

So I’ve been fantasizing about being able to travel again, as I’m sure many of us have been.

solotravel,"(Male/25 years old.)

So, I feel like I've been waiting a long time to have audience for this issue...

I feel like I have no one to connect with. As if there is no one around me that understands me or is on the same *wavelength*. I have just read Mark Manson's, ""The subtle Art of Not Giving A F\*ck"". It gives the advice to basically ""not try"", as far as I can tell, to go with the flow, and to try to acknowledge and consider things like death, entitlement and values that underly ones existence. With this information and more from books like, ""12 Rules for Life"", by Jordan Peterson, I feel like I have tried and am still trying to understand how to better connect.

I currently live in New Haven County Connecticut, in a Group Home setting with two roommates and have interactions with staff throughout most of the day. I feel like I am super angsty in the house and like I just want to run away. I have plans to do effectively this, on a more practical scale. I have been reaching out to summer camps in the Seattle area to try to coordinate employment for the next year. I should mention that these feelings of disconnect, loneliness and feeling like a bit of a misfit have been pervasive since dropping out of college in the spring of 2015.

So, I start asking myself questions in order to see if I could change my behavior in an effort to get along better with those around me. Am I being too insensitive? Am I really insecure? Can I not handle confrontation? My answer to these questions is, ""no, I have thought about it time and time again and I really feel that that isn't the case"". This, addition to a lack of people suggesting that it might be in my daily life leads my to pursue other areas of thought.

One of these areas of thought is my intelligence and or emotional intelligence. I was once at a bar where my brother in law was working when I questioned the bar tender as to why it was that everyone around me seemed to act like some sort of, ""robot"", without, ""without recognition of what was going on around them"" (or something like that), to which he responded, ""let me tell you something kid, if you are smart and in touch with your emotions, life is going to be very, very difficult for you"". This stuck with me and in fact, life up until that point and surely in some time after was very, very difficult with a suicide attempt in the past year.

Another area of thought was my myyers brings personality type, being INFJ. I came to learn that the INFJ personality type is the least common among men. This got me thinking that some of my intellectual and social stress could be due to the infrequency with which I would run into another person with my MBPT.

Another are of thought is that it has something to do with my zodiac sign. From my research on my sign, Aquarians are can be perceived as cold, condescending and over-idealistic . I feel like it is good to be aware of this and try to at least notice when I may be giving off these vibes, but how much control do I have over these qualities and how much should I try to fight them? I am not sure. Aquarians again are seen as intelligent and I feel as though I have always been a bright student, inquisitive and intellectually curious.

So with all of this, the best solution that I can think of is to travel and start meeting different kinds of people to see if I connect. I have been to Boulder, CO, where I lived for a few months but now I think I am on to another adventure. I am wondering, how will I get on with my craving for intellectual stimulation, need to create and collaborate until then?

solotravel,"I got laid off from my corporate sales job in July 2020 and left London after 15 years, aged 30. It was the moment for me to create change in my life, but I have also found myself back at square one. Graduated at 28 (went to Uni late &amp; did a placement year as well), and therefore in total I have about 3 years of 'corporate' world experience across sales/finance. It was a horrible time and enough for me to decide that that isn't for me and that it was time to follow my heart and stop living life a certain way because I felt like I had to.

I'm wondering how many people are in my shoes. That means people in very late 20's and into 30. I really want to and most definitely will travel across CA/SA later this year, COVID permitting. Nothing excites me quite like the adventure of travel. Yet, every other day I can't help but run into guilty and negative thoughts, thoughts about not having a backup career lined up, thoughts about potential long-term CV gap, about not being in a relationship and not having a mortgage or anything like that. I hate being drawn into these worries and thoughts. Now that I'm 30, it's dawned on me that I can either live a care free life where I travel and do my own thing, do casual jobs on the side and generally not stress, or instead go down the usual route and know that for at least 18 years, I have to support my family &amp; probably a mortgage.

I have no background skillset in anything useful that I want to go into. I'm learning computer coding on the side, but who is to say that I will make it? Not guaranteed. It's the fear of the unknown and feeling like I'm being left behind compared to my peers. But then, I remember how miserable I was in London and I look at my friends earning £50-100k and working 8am-8pm or longer every day and think, what the hell is the point in that?

Do others around my age constantly have this confusting state of mind? When I talk to my friends, I don't think they understand as they are mostly career types, which makes me feel isolated with my worries. There's this view that you do this in your 20's and at 30 you are running away from life or yourself or something. I just really want to travel and don't enjoy 9-5 corporate life. It constantly twists my mind trying to work out the best way to execute all of this. Whether I say to hell with what society says and find myself nowhere at 35 and financially not set-up to even finance having kids, or whether I go down the usual route. I guess the secret is something in between, but it seems these people usually have a skillset that they built early in their careers. It's like a weight in my mind that doesn't really go away. At 20, it's not an issue. At 30, it feels like society is leading me to consciously think about the associated risk and instilling fear inside of me.

How do you manage these thoughts and feelings?

solotravel,"Hello everyone! 

So, I recently stumbled on something that seems amazing at first glance: prepaid Visa cards. 

From what I understood it’s ideal for travel, because you can transfer some money to it and use it like a normal card, minus the link to a bank account that risks being emptied if the card is stolen. Seems perfect, everyday you can transfer a day’s worth of budget on it plus a little extra just in case from your bank account and you will only lose that little bit of money in case you get pickpocketed or scammed. 

My question is: is it as good as it sounds? I’ve searched for posts on this on several travel subreddits and haven’t seen it mentioned - or maybe I just didn’t look well enough, I’m a blonde girl after all. 

Also please tell me if I got the flair completely wrong, first time poster here...",Advice on prepaid Visa cards,"Hello everyone!

solotravel,"Hey everyone. Newbie here. Thanks in advance.

So, I've got this whole trip planned out starting tomorrow. Basically, just driving around utah/colorado and hitting national parks for a week. I've got stops and everything planned out, and I'm definitely planning on avoiding any large cities or indoor activities because of covid. Without getting into too much detail, it feels pretty foolproof.

Buuuuuuuuut I'm nervous as shit. Honestly, it's the night before, and I'm not even sure that I want to do it. It's my first time really traveling solo (but I am bringing my dog) and it really just seems like a lot of work. I'm dreading the drive, and I feel like I won't have any human interaction the whole time because of covid.

I don't have another chunk of time off like this for a while, and I really want to do something with it. How can I swallow my anxiety and make it work? How can I make it enjoyable?

Edit: Wow thanks everyone! I'm so glad that I stumbled across this sub. I've realized that bringing my dog was really the part that I dreaded most. While we do hike and ski together, he is still too young for 13hr car rides. He'll be staying with my sister, and I should hopefully have more freedom to do some exploring on my own.",Help!

solotravel,"Hey guys. In 2019 I was super active in this sub and solo’d central/eastern Europe in 3 months and had the experience of a lifetime. In January 2022, I’m hoping to do a similar trip in South America.

My goal is to start in Colombia, head over to Peru and down to Bolivia. Eventually I would catch a flight to Chile to see much of Patagonia (hike the Torres Del Paine). I’d also like to see Buenos Aires. 

Before wrapping it up and heading back to the states, I’d fly to Rio.

Does this all sound feasible in the span of 2-3 months? I know SA is much more difficult and spread out than where I was in Europe, and I’m still looking at the big picture of this trip before I start hammering down what cities/nature trips I’d want to make.

solotravel,"Before things got crazy this past year, I was an avid traveler and took off whenever the chance arose. I enjoy learning about new cultures like anyone else, but the main driving factor behind it was to keep my mind at bay. The high of being in a new place, staying distracted managing things abroad and the welcome hectic nature of it all helped me avoid getting trapped in bad places. I've dealt with OCD, depression, anxiety and general mood liability issues since high school and it's worsened in my twenties. But traveling was a way to escape from all that temporarily. 

Since I've been back at home for the past year, my mental state has gone in the toilet. I had a couple breakdowns that led to me being unable to work for a while, and my ruminating has been extreme. Through all of it, I realized I was using travel as too much of a crutch to avoid looking at myself. I'm not proud of many things I've done in the past and all I was doing was running away from it. Travel is a phenomenal privilege that can have great rewards, but I found that it was becoming too much of a vice for me.

I have a disorder, not diabetes, that requires me to take daily injections and the medication MUST be refrigerated. I also have to take a daily topical gel, and a pill in the morning. 

I was wondering if anybody like me has done long term travel. A plus if you too have medication that has to be refrigerated. How did you get along? How did you stock up or get medication delivered? All answers appreciated.

solotravel,"Hey guys.

I'm going to be traveling to South America in a few months and I just wanted to ask around and see if anyone has any personal experience traveling with a tent and the gear necessary for sleeping outside.

I really would love to have the option to sleep out in natural settings and not be limited to hostels and to constantly be seeking accomodations for sleeping. Carrying a tent would also help me to save money and just opens up a whole lot of possibilities in terms of where I can sleep.

But on the other hand a tent is quite heavy and takes up a lot of room. I prefer to travel light and usually travel with only a small backpack. So I wouldn't be packing only the tent, but also a sleeping bag, foam sleeping pad and pillow. This is really going to add a lot of weight to my set up and seems like it's a huge trade off.

I can either travel super light and limit myself to hostels and hotels, or I can lug around all the pounds of extra gear necessary to sleep outside.

I don't think I really have the funds right now to shell out a bunch of money for an ultralight sleeping set up. 

Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.",Does anyone here have experience traveling with a tent?,"Hey guys.

solotravel,"Before I start, I apologize if some of my questions here appear ignorant, but please bear with me:

I have been traveling solo within most of Asia when I was still living there. I was originally from Taiwan. I've been to all east and south east asian countries (except North Korea, the closest is in the DMZ). I've been to remote areas of Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and East Timor, didn't really have issues anywhere, except some petty stuff like being overcharged in the cities and some language barriers in rural or remote places.

I moved to Canada just before COVID but I've never been outside of the GTA and some surrounding towns. The farthest is in Niagara to the South and Markham to the North. This is my first time outside Asia. Now after COVID I'm planning to travel across North America, likely by myself because I enjoy solo travel. Could be by public transportation if it exists or car. Planning to go North like Yukon or areas in Northern Ontario, or to the United States in places like Texas or Oklahoma. I just like seeing places that are away from the mainstream tourist trail.

I wonder how safe is it and are there any watchouts? I'm referring to safety from the general elements, not necessarily crime because I believe North American countries are generally low in crime.  Reason why I am asking is when I google about solo traveling in North America, I get articles like people suddenly missing (like Death Valley Germans or Madison Family in US, or articles [like this](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/a-woman-vanished-27-years-ago-a-teenager-and-his-gopro-led-police-to-the-bottom-of-a-lake) in canada) and they are presumed to be lost because the area is so big and they are unable to find their way back. The thing is, these people are not even traveling solo. On my head how difficult is it really to find your way back to the main road and are there areas that are really sparsely populated that if you seek for help you won't get any, even from motorists that are passing along the road? Are there places that there's no really people around? How about tracing your steps or directions back?

In my experience in Asia, no matter how remote a village or place is, you will still see one or two huts or small houses from where you can ask for help or anything. I didn't feel that there was a way that I will be lost or something. Furthermore, I believe I can use GPS? Maybe North America is just different in this sense? In my travels going to Niagara from Toronto, some areas appear indeed remote/sparsely populated, like Oakville or St Catharines, but you can still see houses or stores or along the way.

tldr: How to be well-prepared in doing solo travel in North America and not get lost.

I was hoping to get some advice on what the best credit cards for travel are as well as debit cards.  Which credit card do you use?  Is there an ideal combo of debit and credit card to use while traveling?

From the research I've done so far, I'm really liking what Charles Schwab has to offer in regards to their Platinum Visa Debit Card.  No fees and they reimburse foreign ATM fees.  Is this the best debit card to use?

I've also heard good things about the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card.

Thanks, I appreciate any advice and feedback that is offered!

I’ve done some research looking through different threads and asking around but just wanted to have some more to add to my list. Once everything is back to normal and travel is permissible again I just want to make sure I make the most of my trip and choose the best places for that.

solotravel,"So I was adopted from Korea when I was 4 months old and grew up in very suburb Midwest. My second language is Spanish and if I say boat you better believe it sounds like I put an extra ‘a’ in there. 

My question comes from wanting to travel to Asia. I’ve heard wonderful things about all of it and seen plenty on social and heard it’s relatively cheap to travel around most areas. I would love to try all the food and definitely visit my home country at some point. Would love to backpack or buy a moped and road trip as much as I could. Vietnam and Japan look incredible for that. :)

I’m nervous about being an Asian that won’t speak or even slightly understand the languages. I don’t want to appear rude by not speaking a language I feel like they may assume I know.

solotravel,"I’ve been bouncing along the west coast of Costa Rica for the last week. 

Rough Itinerary:
Day 1-2: Playa Hermosa/Playa del coco 
Day 2-3: Tamarindo 
Day 3-5: Samara
Day 5-6: Santa Teresa

What’s going well: 
I love staying in hostels. It’s been great meeting so many new people and hearing their stories. I love learning about how people navigate life. I’ve met some people who are planning on moving here indefinitely and have met some people who live pretty close to me in the states. I have gotten many opportunities to practice my Spanish as well. Only a week and I’m getting better at understanding the language and getting more comfortable speaking it (I’ve taken classes for like 5 years now at school). 

What needs work: 
I don’t have data here, which may be a problem. I’ve been suggested to get a sim or get my carrier to give me coverage so I always have that peace of mind that I could google something wherever I am. I don’t think I can get a sim because I’ve bought my phone and plan through T-Mobile, so I’m probably trapped. So I’d likely have to pay for their international plans or whatever. I can make phone calls fine. I’ve been able to call taxis and stuff. I just don’t have data for the internet and what not. But I’m open to suggestions you guys have to help with this. Or maybe it really isn’t something to be concerned about. 

A story: 
I’ve been planning as I go. So I’ve booked all my hostels already, but didn’t plan transportation or activities in each area. So when I was trying to get from Tamarindo to samara, a taxi was like $120 USD and I was too late to schedule a shuttle to take me directly there. So my hostel host suggested I take 3 buses. Tamarindo to Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz to Nicoya, and Nicoya to samara. This had to have been the biggest Spanish test of my life. When you’re in those beach towns (especially Tamarindo) it’s made for tourists. Some tourists can’t even speak a lick of Spanish. So there are many signs in English and many workers who speak English. But once you really stray away, it hits you. Like I was really stressed when I was taking the buses. I’m at an intermediate level of Spanish, but I really think you need to be advanced to truly get around ok. I pulled it off barely my, but I was in the THICK of it. When there’s no signs in English, everyone around you likely only speaks Spanish, there’s no travel company aggressively trying to sell you a tropical adventure, you’re in a place you’re unfamiliar with, AND THERE’S NO ADDRESSES OR STREET NAMES, it’s do or die (at least it felt this way). So I was really proud I was able to communicate with locals and my bus driver to successfully get to where I needed to go. And it only costed me ~$6 USD. Don’t think I’ll test my luck again tho. It felt really weird just walking around with a carry on bag in just normal small cities. 

What’s next:
I’m still in college and all of my classes are online. So that’s kind of why I’ve chosen to go to Costa Rica. I’m just gonna take my classes here. See something new, live A LOT cheaper than the Bay, experience traveling abroad, try to improve my Spanish, and just take my classes online. I’ll be here for over 2 months so I’m excited for what’s to come. I’m heading to Quepos tomorrow to settle down and start my classes Monday. I’ll also spend some time in limón, puerto viejo, and la fortuna. 

Thanks:
I’m open to any advice, encouragement, wisdom, recommendations, or anything you guys are open to sharing.

You can delete this, if this is isn't supposed to be here.

Lately, this has become really something nerve wrecking, people seem to assume this Sub can predict the future.

It became quite uncanny to scroll through new posts, basically only consisting of oracle-like questions and impossible help seeking.

I think it has affected this sub. I see less engaging overall and some of the better posts just disappear in the sheer amount of above said posts.

Furthermore, it is understandable to need help with budgetting or asking what it's like somewhere else. I mean, i guess that's what the sub is for.

Funnily enough, it seemed to become really common to avoid some info gathering before, google-ing and maybe even select a few countries to be more specific.

A world trip to maybe 6 different nations on 15 continents in Octember 2026 making a stop at the Moon station via Musk-Tours seems more specific, that some of the questions this sub is getting.

Background Information:  I have never travelled to the other side of the world before. I have only been to Mexico and Canada to visit family and friends.  I have started talking to a turkish man on tinder that I find really attractive,  and we clicked really well. I'm residing in Michigan and he was also in Michigan, but visiting. The time we have started talking on tinder was around the time he was about to go back to Istanbul Turkey. He told me that he was visiting Michigan for language school, but he had to go back to his country because it was to expensive. But he wants to come back to America. He just has to work for now until he has enough money to. He also does not speak or understand english but he is learning it. I am also learning turkish on my end as well so that him and I can better communicate. I want to visit him this summer because I will be on summer vacation but it also depends on the situation with the covid cases if thing reopen sometime in March or so.

And plus, I graduate college in the Spring of 2022, so I will not be able to travel out of the country anyways because I will be looking for jobs and all. 

But anyways, I would like to get insights from female redditors more so particular  that have been to Turkey solo.  Istanbul more so because that is where I will be spending most of my time in.

solotravel,"As I am sat here, at home working, not being away in my van like everyone else I have decided to start planning trips. Yes, it might not happen for 2/3 years but need to be doing something!

I have been looking at YouTube videos and blogs and having not planned an overseas holiday in about 4 years I have NO IDEA. I normally go out for a trundle here in the UK and the idea of hiring something that isn't mine scares me a little.

Yay anxiety.

solotravel,"I'm planning my first solo trip, hopefully, and optimistically sometime this summer, and I want this trip to be as open-ended and flexible as possible.  I've really taken to the concept of traveling with no concrete dates, in sort of a nomadic fashion, just staying in a city or country until I get bored and deciding a week or less out where I want to go next and when.  I've seen many posts here and follow many travel vlogers who travel like this and I've been inspired.

However, it seems to me that this style of travel would be much more expensive, particularly when booking flights on such short notice.  Am I wrong?  Is there a good strategy to save money on flights when traveling in this style?

To add more specifics, I'm planning on traveling to Turkey, and then from there, I would like to continue on to at least one or two more countries nearby in the Middle East or the Mediterranean.

solotravel,"Hey, 

So I'm hoping to go away in September this year for as long as possible, I did all of Thailand last year on boxing day for 3 week and absolutely loved it but felt I didn't spend enough time in each part, max was 2/3 days in any one place ! Now single and I'm going to have between £10k-£15k before September. 

Plan is to go around SEA and then on to New Zealand then visit my mum in Australia  for Christmas, if Corona allows it, fingers crossed! 

Roughly how much should I be budgeting on per day? Seen around £30 a day, not looking to go mega cheap but not expensive either.  I have zero costs in Australia so its just Asia budget wise.

Would I be best to book a one way ticket to Bangkok or would I get turned around for not having a return ticket? as I'm not sure where I'll be flying back to the UK from

Meeting people is a worry for myself, I'm not super outgoing and I don't wanna feel isolated for my time I'm away.

Is there a preferred route for south east Asia as well that most people take?

solotravel,"Hi everyone, first post here and first time solo traveller looking for some advice. I'm planning on traveling to India and staying there for a month, most probably in April.   
The idea is to spend the first week in meditation or yoga retreat somewhere in the north of the country, and use the rest of the month to visit natural and historic landmarks throughout the nation.   
The first week of retreat I can figure out pretty easily, I'll just find some good place that offers this kind of things. What I have really no idea about, is how to organize is the last three weeks. I would love to travel the whole country and stay in different places, but how do you organize something like that? Also, I'm on a budget so hostels I guess. Do you book them in advance? Should I just bring a big backpack and no other luggage? Would that work for a month?  


Honestly, at this stage every suggestion is appreciated. I need a lot of brainstorm on something that I have never done before.

solotravel,"Hello all,

I have been brainstorming travel ideas as life begins to slowly crawl towards normalcy again, and have been dying to go on a trip. I have just received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (am an HCW) and am receiving my next dose in two weeks if it is worth mentioning. 

If possible, I'd like to plan this trip for early to mid May. My budget is ideally under $1500 for two weeks in a country in Central America. I also have $150 cashback bonus on my credit card that I plan on putting toward the cost of the flight. I am kind of a history geek as well, but am also interested in somewhere rich in hiking spots, with other activities available (allowing social distancing of course). I Imagine costs for the flight will amount to no more than $350 out of the total 1500. I have found several beachside AirBnbs in Nicaragua around $25 per night!

As for activities, the main thing on my list is finding the best beaches to surf on. I'm open to hiking, fishing, camping, swimming and the like. I live in the deep midwest, and have been a wage slave at my place of work since COVID - am needing to get away from that place for a bit. The language barrier doesn't mean much, I have a decent amount of traveling experience and know enough Spanish to get by. 

In what country can I get the most out of my money?Does 1500 seem like enough for a trip such as this? As the vaccines become distributed, will countries begin to adjust their policy regarding international travelers? 

I have been considering Nicaragua and Costa Rica the most. I've consulted some friends who have traveled Central America and I was told that Nicaragua is too dangerous and Costa Rica is too expensive. What do y'all think?

solotravel,"1)	A phone with battery to last 2 days and MAPS.ME offline maps application. During my early solo travels, getting lost was always something that I was afraid of. Maybe I was hesitant on exploring a neighbourhood because I suspected I wouldn’t find my way back. Maybe I was hesitant to follow a road because it could turn out to be a waste of time. No more of that after I discovered that offline maps can minimise all these issues. You always know where you are and even if you get lost, you can easily find your way back. This made me feel much freer and more increased my eagerness to explore different places in a city.

2)	A good selection of eBooks pre-selected before the trip. Any trip has downtime, maybe a long queue, recovering from a heavy meal at a restaurant or just these few hours at the end of the day to relax. I find that it’s good for the mind to keep busy reading something during those hours. It could be a book related to the place of visit or about the history of the country. It could also be something completely unrelated like a Victorian novel or a non-fiction book about a subject of your interest. It doesn’t matter as long as it compels you to read and keeps your mind busy.

3)	Packing light and a good backpack. When I first arrive in a new location, I don’t want to feel the stress of having to find my accommodation right away because of heavy luggage concerns. For that reason I pack as light as possible with the assumption I must be able to carry the weight throughout the days on my back at all times. It makes my travels a lot more free-spirited. I can wander around the city all day and only go to the hostel/hotel late at night and then leave again early in the morning to maximise sightseeing time.

4)	Leaving flexibility in my plans and being okay with missing MUST-SEE places if they don’t personally interest me. This has greatly freed up my travelling days. My previous approach included listing down let’s say 5 places that the guidebook recommended and then visiting them, this left me feeling like I am doing hard work and sometimes the places themselves felt overrated or not worth seeing. My new approach to mitigate this is to just decide for myself what I want to see – Lonely Planet says a museum on local religious art is number one attraction – great, but I don’t care much for religious art so I will rather spend my 2 hours walking around a neighbourhood and taking photos and trying out local food.

5)	(Advanced-Only) Going in blind without doing any research and not booking any accommodation ahead of time. After being to 30+ countries, travel can start to feel routine. You go to city x, sightsee, sleep at hotel x, then go to city y, sightsee, sleep at hotel y. It’s all a bit predictable. I wanted to feel a sense of chaos and adventure, so I tried out this philosophy on a recent trip to Morocco. I did very little research, the only accommodation I booked was the first night after landing. Then when in Morocco, if I felt like staying an extra day, I could do so, if transport options to go to place x were not available, I simply went to place y, it made the entire trip much more relaxed and spontaneous. There were also more moments of surprise as I had done little research so it felt like exploring the unknown sometimes. The only thing to note here is that this approach can only be done in countries with lower tourist demand (such as South Morocco in early December) as otherwise the price penalty from not booking ahead would be significant.",5 Things That have made Solo Travel more Enjoyable to Me after 30+ Countries - Looking for Other Viewpoints from Travellers,"1)	A phone with battery to last 2 days and MAPS.ME offline maps application.

solotravel,"Travel and tourism are contentious topics right now. For good reason. I see a lot of people on the fence about their planned travels. I'm not trying to shame you. But I'd like you to make as informed and honest a decision as possible. So I'd like to run through some common talking points I see about travel at this moment.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Tourism-reliant places desperately need my money**

This is an unfortunate reality. But it's worth asking yourself one thing. Is this really why you're going on a vacation? If it were your largest motivator, why would a donation not suffice? My favorite clubs are suffering right now too. And yet, it would not make sense for me to go clubbing. Nor would it be a charitable act.

**I am following all the rules**

I think we all agree that just because you can doesn't really mean you should. In many parts of the US, local regulations say you're able to go around without a mask. We know unequivocally that this is wrong. Despite it being allowed within the rules it puts everyone around you in harm's way.

**I'm taking all the necessary safety precautions**

For one, as we all know, a negative result is not a guarantee that you are COVID-free. This puts your flight attendants, pilots, airport/airline staff, taxi drivers, hospitality staff all at needless risk.

Two, the biggest safety precaution that our public health experts have advocated has been ""stay home"". You cannot be abiding by all the recommended safety precautions given that you've violated the biggest one.

**I will be fine even if I get sick**

I'm trying to foster an honest discussion. So honestly, chances are, yes. People on reddit tend to be younger and you'll likely make it out OK. But as people who love to travel, I have to imagine part of the reason why is because you genuinely love the different people and cultures of the world.

Show your compassion and love for these people now with your patience. They are excited for you to come back as much as you are to see them. But there is a time and place. And while it is not now, it will come soon.

--------------------------------------------------------

I know this has been a tremendously difficult experience. But normalcy is so close. A vaccine is within grasp and you will have it soon. Better yet, a vaccine will make your travel experiences exponentially better. And of course, the people and places you love around the world will be much safer too.

I know people can't stay inside their home indefinitely. You need to leave the house once in a while, if just for your sanity. Try local day trips that have minimal exposure to others. I've hiked this year more than I ever have in my life!

And at risk of sounding privileged, consider what a gift time can be. I have never had so much free time in my life before. I've started reading again. I've started playing my cello again after a decade away. I'm taking courses in statistics (for my career) and Spanish (for my future travels). My diet and exercise have never been better! While these luxuries are not something everyone obviously has access to, I imagine if you are considering travel/vacations right now these might be accessible to you too.

Ultimately, I'm a stranger on the Internet and the decision is yours alone. But I think it's important to be honest with oneself about your motivations before making a decision. I hope I've helped in some way to inform an honest assessment when you make your choice.",Making an informed decision about travel at this time,"Travel and tourism are contentious topics right now.

solotravel,"I've done plenty of solo traveling in the past, stayed at hostels, hotels, airbnb's, flown first class and taken obscure local trains. I also have really been into gathering hotel and airline points from credit cards the last 5 years, and using them mostly to fly better airline classes when the flight is over 8 hours long.

solotravel,"Before Covid hit there were countless articles about over-tourism (too many tourists) in places like Paris, Rome, Prague, Barcelona, Venice, etc. Then Covid-19 hit and they went deserted. Have any of you changed your plans (or thought about changing your plans) to avoid contributing to the  problem in the future or maybe avoid crowds where you could more easily get an air-borne disease as crowds are returning? Does anyone live in a city/region that gets too many tourists?

My own city Sofia was becoming way too touristy in 2019 and many here have complained of it losing its authenticity. I quote a friend ""Hearing foreign speech is cool during the first 100 times, after that it makes you feel like the place has been infiltrated and hijacked"" (must be a subconscious thing from prehistoric tribalism lol). Most places where people have been friendly to me are either those where there aren't that many tourists/foreigners (genuine curiosity and interest) OR those that literally rely on tourist money to survive (not very genuine). Locals in cities that are big enough to survive even without foreign tourism are usually less accommodating/welcoming and couldn't care less. Anyone notice this pattern?

The pandemic showed that tourism is a very volatile sector and societies who rely only on it need to diversify. As for me, I've decided to travel to less popular parts of countries (Southeastern/Eastern Poland, Eastern Hungary, Puglia in Italy) and only stick to a few popular touristy places where I really love the place &amp; local culture, but visit them less often (Madeira, Krakow, Stockholm, etc.).

solotravel,"Something was pointed out to me by my family over the holidays(via Zoom). My travel plans have shifted in the year before the pandemic to look for stuff that aren't ""regular"" destinations in earnest.

 I have visited my share of more ""popular"" destinations (Paris, London etc.) and certainly enjoy them. I am not a person who degrades anyone for their choice of travel. I have a great aunt who spoke with me about wanting to go to Rome on her first international trip and said ""but that's just too boring for you"" and I reassured her that any place she wants to go is a good trip for her.

 I mention this because I was told that I have begun to look at places on the basis of the question ""do you know anyone who has traveled to x"" or ""who else do you know has gone to x.""  I was told that I am doing this just to shock people and gain credibility with other travelers as well as one-upping others. I had never thought of it like that, but I had mentioned that I would really like to see Iran and Saudi Arabia. These are two places that have intrigued me since I was young, but as a solo woman traveler, I never thought I'd get the chance. I have read more and more about them and it looks like they are potential options, but I have been told that I would only be doing it because it is uncommon(though probably not on this sub).

I was thinking about it and I guess that is part of the appeal of some places. I'd like to visit the Faroe Island and Svalbard. I'd love to do the Trans Siberian railway and Beijing to Lhasa one as well. These are all places that look cool but am I doing it just because it is less common? My family and friends do not believe that these are places that are actually on anyone's bucket list. They intrigued me for what they are but I can't deny that there is a part of me that thinks ""I will be going somewhere that no one I know would venture to."" It feels adventurous. I was the first person in my family to visit Japan(my first solo trip) and everyone had a meltdown(except my deceased father who accurately predicted that it would be the first of many journeys), and now, as much as I love Japan, it feels a little pedestrian. I'd love to go back, but to explore the more out of the way places.

Sorry, this was long and rabmly, but I am just thrown off a bit, feeling like perhaps my motives for travel are wrong?","Anyone like traveling to places on the basis of ""who else do you know has gone to x""?","Something was pointed out to me by my family over the holidays(via Zoom).

solotravel,"We can all agree since the lockdown, life has taken an interesting route. Personally, my adventure to Switzerland were cancelled and a holiday to Berlin was put on hold. priorities began to focus on other areas of life and no longer being in and out the airports.

My last solo trip was back in January to Portugal, so I was ready for a trip. fortunately, I booked a cheap flight to Palermo and spent 3 nights there to fuel the spark and getting into the zone. March to July (4months) slowly passed and now its time to travel!

Finally made it to my hostel **Bubble Hostel (£5 a night)** after a budget friendly flight to the airport located 15k outside of the centre. When you first step foot outside any airport, the taxis are the first line of defence, but you got to ignore them and find a bus/metro or a train– in Krakow’s case, a bus was the option. Travelling solo allows you to listen to music so always have the freshest Spotify playlist prepared you’re your adventure.

Arriving from the UK were BoJo was doing his best impersonation of Vicky Pollard (Picture Daily mirror of this). You would expect the clubs and bar crawl to be closed... You are wrong! Whilst I was in Poland, I went on the same bar crawl 5 times! All nightclubs open until 5am and later. It seems to me that Covid must go to sleep at midnight.  Forget the new normal because I am now back in the normal. 1m floor signs and masks still to be worn in indoor spaces, Gyms fully open and no need to book. This was a blessing as gyms only reopened later on in the UK...and of course closed again

During my month in ‘Eastern’ Europe you allocentrics may call it - to me its Central Europe. It seemed very calm and controlled compared to the state in the UK. It continued like this for the whole month.

The flight situation was the there was no blocking of seats, however on all three flights I experienced, there was the luxury of a row to myself. The bus situation is that there are no blocking of seats and it seemed normal. The only thing what was different is that you have to wear a masks in both areas

Headphones in and listening to the varies songs and occasionally podcast – I ventured on the explore the main attractions of Krakow (Pictures). There are positives travelling in Covid, as the sites become quieter and as a tourist, it is an opportunity to appreciate the sites. On the other hand, less people on the bar crawls, but the locals did not disappoint.

When visiting a new country, it is always best to learn a few words to impress the locals whenever you’re in a bar and had too much to drink. I experienced many friendly people and never felt unsafe in Poland as everyone I met was very welcoming. In my first hostel, I met a few German lads who I had a chat to about the city they were from and my limited knowledge on to Bundesliga. Travelling around, I feel like football is a universal language (Especially being from Manchester) as people smile when you just mention a few players from their country or team.

3 days into Krakow, I reluctantly switched hostels to **Willa Retro Hostel (£9 a night)** as I enjoyed the free coffee/tea and breakfast offered by the Bubble Hostel. In the new hostels garden was a very chilled vibe with music and socializing taking place.A complete opposite to what lockdown offered in the months of April and May. At this point, my excitement levels jumped despite I had no plans on the coming month.

A few days later, I agreed on an itinerary exploring the southern areas of Poland. This include the cities of Katowice – Wroclaw – Lodz – Warsaw – Lublin – Zakopane (via Krakow). Spontaneously after a chat to a stranger at 4am in a Krakow nightclub I decided to go to Budapest BUT turns out I had to go before the 1st September as Hungary were closing their borders. I did not know this prior purchasing the Flixbus tickets from Krakow – Kosice (Slovakia) then Kosice – Budapest.

Sad to be leaving Krakow I ventured on to Katowice just for the night. I can’t say much about this city but around this time there were protest against the current government on their views on gay rights so I spectated a fairly peaceful protest in the city centre. **Hostel Sentral (£9 a night)** was seen as a bargain as I was one of two people in my dorm - another common theme

Few hours on the morning bus ride to Wroclaw was relaxing as there was no people around me. This was a regular theme throughout my trip. Travelling in Covid was a dream for exploring. Wroclaw was a lovely surprise due to it reminding me what Krakow was like with the beautiful architecture. Labelled as a university city, I did notice the student scene as the parks on the river were full of life with people drinking and just socializing. This was a completely different approach to the UK due to no more than 6 people meeting up. Still amazed that the gyms still open and the evening atmosphere in the centre still alive. You wouldn’t see a soul enjoying life in the major cities of the UK. I didn’t stay much in **Absynt Hostel (£6 a night)** as there were many areas to check out. (Pictures of stadium, centre and park) It had that big city feel which I wernt expecting but I can see this city picking up a reputation and I would recommend anyone to visit

On to the lesser known cities of Poland – Lodz. Another cheap and safe journey by Flixbus and I was greeted by the presence of nothing. A massive bus station filled with nothing. I don’t know if this is because of Covid or the bus station is too big for the city?

The same greeting, I had from the bus station was the same greeting I had when I entered my dorm at the **Cynamon Hostel (£8 a night)** Nothing. No one entered my room for the next 3 nights I was there, and I’m convinced there was no one else in the entire hostel. An entire hostel for £24 pounds for 3 nights. Royalty. Lodz isn’t too popular with tourist, but I’m surprised to see no domestic tourists. It was the weekend, so it gave me an opportunity to check out the nightlife. Over this weekend I watched the demolition Bayern Munich did to Barcelona.. watched on Bein sport with some guys from the Middle East. No English spoken it seems in these parts of Poland and so just ordering a simple drink was complicated. I laughed with the locals, whilst not understanding a word but the music was good!

Warsaw... second time in Warsaw for me after visiting with friends back in March 2019. One of my favourite buildings is located in this city (Palace of Cultural &amp; Science) but apart from that..eurgh. When travelling, I think when you travel to the capital, it does not represent the country, so travelling to the second cities to countries it gives a fairer review of a country. One of the many few positives Warsaw holds is that there’s an impressive beach where you can chill! **City View Lucka Hostel (£5 a night).** Not the best hostel but I was bound to encounter a negative hostel experience especially when hopping from hostel to hostel. Moving on..

Travelling again with Flixbus to the next city on the eastern side of Poland which is Lublin. Prior to coming to this surprisingly close-knit town, I didn’t do any research as I wanted to be surprised.. and I was! A standard old town filled with the coloured buildings and hosting an impressive castle casting over the town. I would recommend this place and recommend the hostel as well **Folk Hostel (£8 a night).** Finally I weren’t alone in a dorm, as I got talking to a few of the tourist. Just by luck a Hungarian girl was staying in the dorm as I ended up getting her contacts as I planned to visit Budapest. Also, a hostel first for me was that a dog was staying in the room, was a very cute dog and caused no problem aww. The main attraction in this town is the Concentration Camp located on the outskirts of the city. Vast area with a handful of people in the grounds. Highly recommended if your interested in the history of the surroundings.

Flixbus again of course back to where it all started. How much has Krakow changed with Covid restrictions since I was last there a few weeks ago? Turns out, not much as I met up with the bar crawl lads and seshed to 6am with varies nationalities including France, Netherlands and even the UK.  As a solo traveller it is a great way to meet people and connect with as when you’ve had a drink you would make friends with anybody. In and out of hostels It is always good to splash out (not too much) on an apartment for a few days to recharge the batteries. A dumb move by me was the book an apartment by the train station - **JM Rooms Lubicz 10 (£15 a night)** .. wonder why it was so cheap!

Afternoon bus to the hidden beauty of Zakopane. Only 3 hours from Krakow and I highly recommend visiting if you ever get the opportunity. I expect it to be packed because of the many walking routes you can do in summer, in contrast to the skiing in winter. I really did get that Austrian mountains vibe but with such cheap prices. One to visit again in the future, unreal views UNREAL. **Willa Mavi (£13 a night)** topped it for me as I decide to stay in apartment with views of the mountains. BONUS: it had a bathtub! When you visit the bordering regions of Poland/Slovakia, you got to check out the ‘Morskio Oko’. Even in these Covid times, get to the bus station early to beat the crowds because you would like the lake for yourself.

A completely different side of Poland I thought id never encounter with the fresh air and amazing views. I returned to Krakow feeling content knowing it was the weekend, so I had to go on a bar crawl on my last night of Krakow. I sure did that and stayed out until 6… No 10pm pubs shutting here but hey ho, you people in the UK had 50% off food.

Next day was off to a new place in a new country – Kosice, Slovakia. Was a lengthy bus journey and no trouble crossing the border. I thought because of Covid there would be trouble but no there was no problem whatsoever but could I leave Slovakia and enter Hungary... who knows lets risk it.

It’s a shame for Slovakia because it is positioned in between their well-known neighbours of Poland &amp; Hungary. I personally not too interested in the country and yes I have been to the capital - Bratislava last year (not solo).

My mind was just thinking about if I can enter Hungary, but I would have to take a overnight train to Ruzemberok then a bus down to Budapest. Thankfully, no issues on crossing the borders. The date was 31/08/2020 so one day just before the borders close. From the bus station to the hostel was just an easy metro ride to the centre. It really is not hard to direct your way around the major cities of Europe just follow the maps on offer and use google maps. The metro to the centre was a quick ride and I was soon ready to check in…but it was 7am. Most hostels/hostels accept check ins at 2pm so knowing this I booked the night before and with hope I could sleep the morning away in Budapest. Long story short that was not possible. After chatting to an Italian girl about her city Torino, who was working in the **Hostel One Basilica (£5 a night)** I explored the attractions such as the Parliament Building, Chain Bridge and many more.  The busiest attraction would be the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, but we are in a global pandemic.

The nightlife in Budapest did not disappoint despites it was Covid. Luckily my hostel was full of outgoing people who worked in the hostel and knew the best places to party. A tip for any student travelling is to research the citys Erasmus page and check if there are any events. This is because the beer tends to be cheaper!!! I was successful in my search for an Erasmus night. The entry was cheap, and the drinks were cheap but of course they were because Budapest is cheap!! So many people in these Covid times into a strange nightclub with many corridors to apply. Just a few hours ago I was talking to my mates how we miss a normal night out..oops. Further few nights were spent in the capital and I met up with the same girl from Lublin. She showed me around the city, and we talk about many different topics.

Thankfully I could escape Hungary as i could catch my flight to Zakynthos in Greece where my solo adventure would end. Party time!

The nightlife in Budapest did not disappoint despites it was Covid. Luckily my hostel was full of outgoing people who worked in the hostel and knew the best places to party. A tip for any student travelling is to research the citys Erasmus page and check if there are any events. This is because the beer tends to be cheaper!!! I was successful in my search for an Erasmus night. The entry was cheap, and the drinks were cheap but of course they were because Budapest is cheap!! So many people in these Covid times into a strange nightclub with many corridors to apply. Just a few hours ago I was talking to my mates how we miss a normal night out..oops. Further few nights were spent in the capital and I met up with the same girl from Lublin. She showed me around the city, and we talk about many different topics.

Thankfully I could escape Hungary as i could catch my flight to Zakynthos in Greece where my solo adventure would end. Party time!

solotravel,"I have a shoebox full of mementos from the time I lived in Europe - city maps, wristbands, concert tickets, restaurant menus, drink coasters, notes from friends, newspaper clippings, you name it. 

I was a *very* broke university student, so I couldn’t afford many meaningful souvenirs. I had to skip out on a lot of paid museums and restaurants for the same reason. Almost all of my money went toward Flixbus or budget Ryanair flights, spontaneous hostel reservations, and quick stops at grocery stores for beer and whatever cheap groceries I found affordable enough to hold me over for my time there (usually bread, a protein, and my fair share of greasy street food).

I may not have gotten the most in-depth cultural experience in each country, but it was a uniquely humble method of diving in and adapting to each new place. I’m not from a wealthy family whatsoever, so the worldly thinking I developed was life changing. The memories I made were well worth the struggles. I keep telling myself I’ll go back to some of my favorites someday - I think now I can afford a few €15 meals :) 

I’m doing better for myself now, much less vagabond but trying to keep up my share of unique travels. Feeling deprived (thanks COVID), I pulled my box from the back of a shelf for the first time in about 3 years and was understandably hit with a massive wave of nostalgia. Sure, it’s just a box of scraps, but to me it’s tangible proof that this weird, recurring dream I hold so dearly in the back of my mind was once reality. It’s a tiny reminder of the sweet, sweet freedom I once felt as a student, holding these same maps in these same hands as I happily navigated myself through new worlds with pure, bare-boned happiness. I realized I’ll never be able to share these feelings and bits of memories with anyone but myself but that’s what makes the old shoebox so beautiful.


Anyone have similar stories to share?

solotravel,"I have a three-month furlough coming up this summer and I'd like to to something fun. Last time I had a furlough, I went to Peru for a month. This time I'm thinking of an extended stay in Mexico, specifically Monterrey. I live in New Mexico, and would cross with my own car, as I would like to bring my two dogs with me. I'm interested in probably renting an AirBnB for a month or so and just exploring that city/area and improving my Spanish. I'm a solo woman traveler and I'm already fluent in Spanish. I've been to Mexico a number of times including studying in Mazatlan and a two week solo trip to Oaxaca and Puebla in 2018. All the same, I've never drove my own vehicle in a foreign country. Is the road from Laredo to Monterey safe? Is there anything I should know about driving in that part of Mexico? I live in New Mexico but specifically chose the Laredo route, as it would require the least solo driving in Mexico. I know I have to purchase insurance when I cross, but I don't know any specifics of that. I'm honestly also interested in getting all the way down to Mexico City and seeing Guanajato and San Luis Potosi on the way, but that seems quite overwhelming to me. Any thoughts on going that far south by car as well?

\*\*EDIT\*\* I should have said late summer/early fall, because this wouldn't be until at least August, if not September or October (and actually leaning toward October because my house sitter wouldn't have to water my garden as much). Anyway, I would only do it if it's responsible to do it at the time. I'm hoping Covid will be much more under control by then and I should be vaccinated as well.

**UPDATE:** I randomly met a woman a few days ago in this online Spanish group I'm part of who lived in Monterrey for four years. I asked her about it and she told me she did not recommend the drive and had never done it unless she was in a group with her Mexican friends. After talking to her, I have decided to err on the side of caution. I've heard that there are other locations on the west coast that would probably be safer. Thanks everyone for your input!

It's especially hard that we're in a middle of a pandemic. I'm lucky I found a job now that enables me to support my family while I get to save some money for my own, too.

I really want to be able to travel alone and hopefully be able to stay for quite some time outside of the country. A few months maybe, I still don't know. But as the eldest daughter, although I'm already almost 24, I still feel guilty when I think of leaving my family.

How did you do it, women of Reddit? Also, can you tell me which countries have you travelled to and stayed in for a while? I would love to hear your stories, please. I want to be inspired and make this goal really happen.

It's especially hard that we're in a middle of a pandemic. I'm lucky I found a job now that enables me to support my family while I get to save some money for my own, too.

I really want to be able to travel alone and hopefully be able to stay for quite some time outside of the country. A few months maybe, I still don't know. But as the eldest daughter, although I'm already almost 24, I still feel guilty when I think of leaving my family.

How did you do it, women of Reddit? Also, can you tell me which countries have you travelled to and stayed in for a while? I would love to hear your stories, please. I want to be inspired and make this goal really happen.

solotravel,"I am a 21 year old located in Australia. Initially I was very career-driven but now I am starting to realise that COVID aside, I may never be in a better position to travel than I am now.

I am currently on a $63k salary with about $10k in savings. I would like to quit my job this/next year (depending on the COVID situation) and travel for a few months before getting another job. I am single and live pretty cheaply, so I envisage my savings increasing over the next few months.

I have an undergraduate law degree and about 4 years of work experience behind me, so i feel fairly confident that I wouldn’t be rendered unemployable by an extended travel period.

I realise that living costs vary but I am not fussy on travel locations - I just like to see new places. Would I be able to support myself on $20k in a foreign country, or do solo travellers pick up odd jobs along the way?

solotravel,"Hi all. I’m hoping to go on a 417 Australian Working Holiday in January 2022 (assuming that boarders are open, and things are relatively back to ‘normal’) and so, looking for some advice. 

I’ve really dreamt of this trip for the last 2 - 3 years, researched and planned in depth, and used it as motivation to get to the end of uni (it would be a post-graduate travel gap year). At some points, it’s been all I could think about; the sun on my skin, seeing the Blue Mountains, taking a surf lesson, sailing the Whitsundays... However, now that it’s becoming ‘real’ and I’m getting closer to having to make actual decisions e.g applying for a visa and booking flights, I’m getting a bit nervous. I’m a fairly reserved and introverted person with, to be honest, a fair amount of general and social anxiety. I’ve lived by myself, a few hours from home, for the last year, and have traveled both locally and abroad many times before - with friends and family. Here, on holidays, I usually love every minute, largely the ‘doing’ element; the activities, the sights and experiences etc. but I’ve not travelled by myself before, let alone stayed in a hostel, and now, am questioning whether I can follow through with what I would love to do vs. what I’m capable of doing. A few family members, who I’m sure mean well, have basically told me not to go, due to my quietness and / or because of going by myself (I don’t know any friends or family who are either not in uni or work, or who are financially stable enough etc.), whilst my best friend encourages me to go for it.

So, any tips / experiences / suggestions for:
- Solo travelling for the first time (for females, in particular). 
- Anxiety and travelling. 
- Solo travelling / anxiety whilst on an Australian Working Holiday.

It’s been an interesting year to say the least haha - and I’m looking forward to being able to (solo) travel again :)

An interesting experience with solo travel - last year I traveled by myself to Quebec City for New Years (and I’ve done solo New Years another time in Montreal) and had a lot of fun with folks I met there!

Today as I’m wishing people a Happy New Year, besides my family, funny enough the group that we formed last year (also on WhatsApp) for New Years feels more like the group of people I’d love to spend another New Year’s Eve with!

While I was there I met my boyfriend and have since decided to move to Perth to go be with him.

Has anyone gotten COVID while in a foreign country? I don’t plan to travel until the vaccine, but I’m really curious how people are handling this.

Obviously it would be very unethical to move about  once you have symptoms, so what do you do? 

Cancel all forward (or return) travel until you clear a PCR 2-3 weeks later? Tell the hotel you are sick and can’t leave if you are supposed to check out?

If you are hostel bound, I wonder if they would just kick you out. Where do you go from there?! Seems inappropriate to check in to a new hotel or AirBnb once you are sick.

I need some travel advice for my Balkan trip. I found a really cheap flight from Canada to Bucharest, Romania for Summer 2021. I don't know if it's because of COVID but it's usually really expensive to fly to Eastern Europe from Canada. 

Anyways, I'm planning on flying out of Toronto and arriving in Bucharest, Romania. From Bucharest, I'm planning on going to Varna, Bulgaria and the Black Sea in general so cities like Varna, Burgas, etc. in Bulgaria.

How many of you have visited Bucharest or Varna? How many days do you think I should spend in both Bucharest in Varna? Should I also check out Constanta, Romania which is on the Black Sea? Should I check out Sofia, Bulgaria as well? How do I travel between Romania and Bulgaria? Is FlixBus an option in Eastern Europe? Or should I use Union Ivkoni? Has anybody used Union Ivkoni before and how reliable are they? Furthermore, what kind of budget do you recommend for Romania and Bulgaria? Any must-see attractions or activities or things to do in either Romania or Bulgaria?

solotravel,"Hi guys,
Assuming coronavirus is sufficiently contained by 2021 summer*, I was hoping to go solo travelling. I am European and will have finished my final exams. Usually people after these exams go travelling with friends around Europe, however, I wanted to do something different. It's not that I have no friends to travel with, more that the last few years and my childhood in general have been difficult, and I feel like I am starting a new chapter in my life. As cheesy as it sounds, I am dying for some alone time somewhere foreign, where I can engage my love of travel and learning, as well as taking time for introspection and learning more about myself. I would aim to spend about one month or one month and a half travelling - much more than I could in Europe, given that Latin America is cheaper from what I understand.

Latin America has always fascinated me, which is why I really want to visit. Not only the culture, but also its history and its current interesting socio-economic situation, with countries like Mexico and Brazil straddling middle-income status, next to more developed nations like Chile and Uruguay. I am fairly fluent in Spanish (approx. C1 level), and am learning Portuguese.

I should mention right off the bat that I'm a city guy: I like buildings, I like museums, architecture, learning about the history and socio-economic and political situation of different places around the world. That said, I can and do appreciate nature when I get the chance; I'm just not the type to go hiking and trekking, more the type to sit and admire the scenery.
With that all said, I have a few questions:

What is the ideal itinerary? I had a few different ones in mind:
(-&gt; is by bus, =&gt; is by air)

Belo Horizonte -&gt; Sao Paulo -&gt; Curitiba -&gt; Iguazu Falls -&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima &amp; Cusco OR Bogota

or

Buenos Aires =&gt; Ushuaia =&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Mendoza -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima, Cusco OR Bogota

or some combination of the two. 

Other cities of interest are Florianopolis, Porto Alegre and Asunción. Nothing is concrete yet, I'm really just playing around with ideas right now. From what I understand, many of the nature parks in South Brazil aren't accessible by public transport, which is why I haven't considered them.

2) As a first time (male) solo-traveler, is visiting Latin America - Brazil in particular - a good idea?
I am well aware that there are crime problems in Brazil. Although most of the dangerous cities appear to be in the North East, where I don't plan on going, I have still heard bad things about Sao Paulo, and even worse things about Rio, which is why I haven't even considered Rio for travel at all, and am cautious about considering Porto Alegre (please do tell me if this is silly or not). I have never had a gun pulled on me, or been the victim of violent crime; the only ""robbery"" I have experienced are street muggings by unarmed people when I was younger.

However, I should also mention that my family is of Indian origin; my family in India, who I regularly visit, live in a fairly poor/deprived part of Delhi, so I'm not unfamiliar with the discomforts of travelling in less developed regions. I have visited Chicago, Washington D.C., and the outskirts of Detroit, if that makes a difference.

I am also fortunate enough to be fairly well travelled with my family; we tend to do budget city breaks when we travel in Europe, which entails using lots of public transit, and sometimes staying in slightly shadier parts of town. Again, I am aware European ""danger"" is nothing relative to Brazil.

With all this mind, am I too ""inexperienced"" to go to Brazil (and/or Colombia)? What about Buenos Aires, Patagonia and Santiago?

Thanks for reading this far and for any help! And I'll repeat this is all very very speculative at the moment and something I am only just considering as a possibility, so if this is a crazy/dumb idea do say so!

*I am aware that this is very hopeful thinking, which is why I am not taking this plan overly seriously: I am not booking anything anytime soon. If it is not safe enough to travel in 2021 summer, I would still like to do this trip the following year, so any advice is still appreciated!","18 y/o, First Time Solo Travel to Latin America, Advice Needed","Hi guys,

I am 19F here and planning my first solo international trip to Colombia in 2021 (if covid allows). I am student with over $6000 USD in savings that I want to travel with and since school is online, I can study anywhere I want and I feel like this is best time in my life to travel because of that despite my family telling me I will make it back in a body bag. So, I was planning on spending most of my time,2-3 weeks in Cartagena since I enjoy the beach more than anything. But I have heard Santa Marta is better so that is not set in stone. I also am planning at least 5 days in Medellin and same with Cali. I have heard some bad stories about Bogotá and am wondering if it worth planning some days there??? 

I am planning on using air bnbs. I know a lot of solo travelers use hostels but I like my privacy. I am not looking to party much. I do not know much Spanish though, I have been studying on and off for about a year along with some classes at my college but would only consider myself to be conversational. 

My questions:
- Is Bogotá worth spending a few nights in?
- Is Colombia relatively safe for young solo female? I am not sure how well I will blend in as I am a tall pale redhead. But I know not to go out at night, hide my valuables, same precautions I take in any big city alone. 
- Is there any must see attractions in Colombia?
- It looks like you can take overnight buses in between the bigger cities but it is just better to pay for a flight in between??

solotravel,"Hello,

I am planning visit Barcelona to obtain medical imaging this January. I have been in contract with a neurosurgeon's office who informed me that I am able to skip quarantining upon arrival as the trip is for a medical appointment.

However, I was reading into the Government of Canada website that details the travel restrictions that says the following ""Travelers arriving from Canada are not allowed entry to Spain. However, certain travelers may be allowed entry if they can prove the essential nature of their travel or if they meet specific criteria.""

However the link to the specific criteria doesn't details what falls under ""essential nature"". I was wondering if the trip is for medical reasons and I have documentation showing I am going to visit a neurosurgeon would I be allowed entry to Barcelona.

Additionally, as I am 21 and unfamiliar with international travel and Barcelona I was wondering if I would additionally be allowed to bring a friend to accompany me on my trip.

List of questions:

1) What are the procedures before I travel to Spain

2) Would I be allowed entry for medical purposes

3) Can I bring a friend to accompany me, and would he or she also be allowed to skip quarantine

3) Do i need pre flight covid tests/ and testing when I land

solotravel,"TL;DR: Planning to travel in June'21 or when the world opens up. Looking for a place where I can learn Spanish and have easy access to trail running and hiking.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all, I've saved enough to take a 6-8 month break from work and not be worried about it. I was planning to travel in June or whenever the world is safe for travel again (whatever comes later). I don't need to hit up too many places but am content with staying longer in a few locations, focusing on my well being and getting immersed in the local culture.

Three things I did want to do are:

1. Learn Spanish (current proficiency: Basic)
2. Photography (current proficiency: Intermediate)
3. Hiking and trail running (current proficiency: Intermediate +)

I wanted your advice/experience on places where I could be part of some Spanish immersion program and have easy and safe access to some great outdoors. (Safe =  where I could hit the trails almost every day without worrying about having a guide or a group accompany me)

Below are a few places I've been to before and would love to return and stay longer, but unsure of the Spanish programs there. Would love feedback on them or any other similar places you'd recommend:

* Peru: Huaraz or Cusco (loved Huaraz!)
* Argentina: Bariloche (though it'll be winter in June/July)
* Spain: San Sebastian (passed through it on a hike and loved the town) or Mallorca
* Guatemala: Antigua or Lake Atitlan (loved it but was always told not to venture far without company)

I've heard great things about Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador but have not been yet. Not a high roller but pretty open on budget.

Thanks for the help!",Spanish Immersion Program + hiking trails,"TL;DR: Planning to travel in June'21 or when the world opens up. Looking for a place where I can learn Spanish and have easy access to trail running and hiking.

This is my first road trip/solo trip! I am getting out of the military Aug 2021. I am going to sell a lot of my belongings and travel with what I can fit in my toyota corolla.

solotravel,"I plan on doing a backpacking trip across Turkey and potentially parts of the Soviet Union this May. 

My itinerary is

1. Fly from US to Turkey via Paris on Air France. Free 23 kg check in baggage
2. Travel around Turkey using Turkish Airlines, trains, busses, or Skyexpress airlines. All airlines allow free check in baggage 
3. (If all countries lift Covid rules by then): Public transport or Train from Turkey to Georgia. Then Georgia onto Yerevan, Armenia. I will skip this section if countries still have covid rules.
4. Fly from either Turkey or Armenia to Kyiv, Ukraine. Airline will be either Ukraine International or Skyup. 23kg checked baggage will cost $15-$25
5. If the EU allows US travelers by then. Fly from Kyiv to Warsaw Poland on Skyup. Checking in will cost $13 (which is 50% of the cost of the flight). Then fly from Warsaw to Chicago on Tap Portugal. This will cost me an extra $50 vs purchasing the Tap Discount fare. 

So basically, I will be paying an extra $80 ish to bring in a checked in suitcase on board all my flights. I'm just not sure if I can bring 3-4 weeks worth of stuff in a backpack.

Moved into a hostel about 2 days ago, due to start working for accommodation on Saturday for hostel, so currently still paying. The room i've moved into is next to a noisy room, where people want to stay up late, have their friends in the room til late playing music, banging door to get in. It's annoying.

So after the second night of this happening, wakes me up at 1:30am (i've got work all day for a client so not good) - I knock the door ask them to turn music down, ignored. Knock again, finally stops. 

The next morning, I realise the noisy person is also the night manager and the cleaner, who angrily barks at people who don't clean up after themselves. So instead of going straight to reception to complain, I decide to speak with my new colleague now she is sober, and it's morning to ask her to go downstairs next time she hosts a party because we're neighbours. She goes crazy. Mental. Before I know it, she's cornering me in the bathroom threatening to punch me in the face. I can't move, she's actually physically blocked me with the steam cleaner. I keep my cool, stand my ground, until a girl brushing her teeth breaks it up. But she's not finished with me, she returns seconds later, telling me how she's going to shove my head in the toilet. At this point - I go to the manager, who is already coming out to see what the racket is all about. But the girls following me down the corridor, telling me about how she can't wait to put my head in shit. 

An hour later, she is removed from the hostel and ever since she has been wandering the street, walking around the block for a good solid 6 hours.

solotravel,"Hey brothers and sisters!

After making a lot of research I took the chance and visited Russia for 30 days in September and October 2020. Russia was always a dream destination for me and I was happy that I could still pull it off this year, despite all the obstacles that Corona put upon us.

**Disclaimer:** I am aware that I visited Russia as a foreign citizen for recreational, touristic purposes during a global pandemic. I hereby declare that everyone willing to travel should do his/her careful research about travelling in this era and what the the possible consequences of such a trip are. I therefore am not endorsing nor discouraging anyone from doing a trip nowadays - I'm just saying that you should do your careful research first.

**Background:** 29M Swiss, mostly have adventurous backpacking experience in Asia. Very interested in Russian / former Soviet culture and history. I can read Cyrillic and have some very basic Duolingo Russian skills, but apart from that I can't understand sh** and are pretty bad at everything. The trip took place between September and October 2020, right before the Corona numbers again went off the roof. 

**Budget:** About USD 50 per day, not including airfare or visa fees etc. Because of the current global situation the highest expenditure was the flight Zurich-Moscow and back, which only operated twice a week. But because my flight options were pretty limited I swallowed this bitter pill and did it.

**Length of Travel:** 30 days

**Destinations (not including daytrips):** Saint Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Moscow, Volgograd, Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta, Vladikavkaz, Grozny, Erzi (Southern Ingushetia)

**Accommodations:** Either cheap hotels (found via HotelsCombined or Agoda) or at friends' or at guides' homes.

**Arrival:** The Corona pandemic makes planning an international trip obviously much more difficult than normally. While getting the 30 days visa was not a problem (only citizens from Switzerland, UK or Turkey could obtain tourist visas at that time), I also had to get a negative PCR test result 72 hours prior to my flight (in English or Russian language). This already set me back quite some money and time. At the airport in Switzerland my test result was checked very carefully by the departure staff and arriving in Moscow Domodedovo the Russian officials again checked the result along with my current body temperature. The procedures at immigration and security didn't take too long though (about 1.5 hours) since there were almost no travelling tourists but only returning Russian citizens. Many people were quite amazed to see a foreigner traveling at that time. Immediately after getting my backpack from the baggage claim I headed to the domestic check-in counters and took a domestic flight to Saint Petersburg, which also worked flawlessly.

**Activities:**

* Visiting the many landmarks in Saint Petersburg, such as Peter &amp; Paul, Artillery Museum, Peterhof or Kronstadt
* Visiting Kizhi Island and renting a car to visit other landmarks in Karelia (such as Ruskeala)
* Visiting Moscow and its many landmarks, such as Red Square, Kremlin, Bunker 42, Federation Tower or Monino Aircraft Museum
* Visiting Suzdal (Golden Ring) and its many churches and monasteries
* Visiting Volgograd and its landmarks such as Rossoshka Cemetary, Square of the Fallen Fighters, the war museums, Mamayev Kurgan
* Visiting the Southern part of Crimea, such as Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta and Bakhchysarai. Lots of daytrips such as to Artillery Bay, Crimean War panorama, Chersonesus ruins, Maxim Gorky fortress, Submarine base in Balaclava, Cape Fiolent, Ai Petri or Chufut-Khale
* Vladikavkaz, Karmadon Gorge and the Necropolis in Darvgas
* Grozny and a wonderful trek in Galanchezh region of Chechnya
* Southern Ingushetia including treks to Table Mountain and Erzi National Reserve

**What Went Right:** Pretty much everything major - despite the limitations by Corona everything in general went smooth without any incidents. Most landmarks and transporation options worked flawlessly.

**What Went Wrong:** Some few landmarks like Ostankino Tower in Moscow were closed without a comment due to the Corona measures and sadly couldn't be visited. Also many Western bank cards, credit cards and SIM cards won't work in Crimea due to Western sanctions, meaning you need to have some backup. Also because of annoying Corona measures I lost one day of travel between North Ossetia and Chechnya (which is a long story though).

**Recommendations:** GO TO RUSSIA (especially when the whole Corona circus is over).

**Final Verdict:** While maybe not as super adventurous and wild as South East Asia or the Middle East, Russia is a phenomenal mix of European and Oriental influences with extremely many facettes. Compared with other regions in the world it's also a safe and stable destination for a backpacking trip. Locals are lovely and hospitable people, especially in the countryside and in the south. The country simply has everything to offer for every taste, and even within 30 days you can only explore a fraction of the whole picture. While it was not my absolute favorite solo backpacking experience (that would rather be Iran or Vietnam) Russia is still very high in my personal list and I recommend anyone to visit it when things calm down again.

* Visiting Kizhi Island and renting a car to visit other landmarks in Karelia (such as Ruskeala)
* Visiting Moscow and its many landmarks, such as Red Square, Kremlin, Bunker 42, Federation Tower or Monino Aircraft Museum
* Visiting Suzdal (Golden Ring) and its many churches and monasteries
* Visiting Volgograd and its landmarks such as Rossoshka Cemetary, Square of the Fallen Fighters, the war museums, Mamayev Kurgan
* Visiting the Southern part of Crimea, such as Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta and Bakhchysarai. Lots of daytrips such as to Artillery Bay, Crimean War panorama, Chersonesus ruins, Maxim Gorky fortress, Submarine base in Balaclava, Cape Fiolent, Ai Petri or Chufut-Khale
* Vladikavkaz, Karmadon Gorge and the Necropolis in Darvgas
* Grozny and a wonderful trek in Galanchezh region of Chechnya
* Southern Ingushetia including treks to Table Mountain and Erzi National Reserve

**What Went Right:** Pretty much everything major - despite the limitations by Corona everything in general went smooth without any incidents. Most landmarks and transporation options worked flawlessly.

**What Went Wrong:** Some few landmarks like Ostankino Tower in Moscow were closed without a comment due to the Corona measures and sadly couldn't be visited. Also many Western bank cards, credit cards and SIM cards won't work in Crimea due to Western sanctions, meaning you need to have some backup. Also because of annoying Corona measures I lost one day of travel between North Ossetia and Chechnya (which is a long story though).

**Recommendations:** GO TO RUSSIA (especially when the whole Corona circus is over).

**Final Verdict:** While maybe not as super adventurous and wild as South East Asia or the Middle East, Russia is a phenomenal mix of European and Oriental influences with extremely many facettes. Compared with other regions in the world it's also a safe and stable destination for a backpacking trip. Locals are lovely and hospitable people, especially in the countryside and in the south. The country simply has everything to offer for every taste, and even within 30 days you can only explore a fraction of the whole picture. While it was not my absolute favorite solo backpacking experience (that would rather be Iran or Vietnam) Russia is still very high in my personal list and I recommend anyone to visit it when things calm down again.

Would you do anything differently post-pandemic? This is independent of destination, just when you personally would realistically book a trip internationally.

solotravel,"I know I'm not original in my sentiments here.

I had just discovered how much I love international solo travel earlier this year before the pandemic spread far and wide. I was going to make plans to travel more over the summer before going back to school. It would have been perfect, because I wanted to go backpacking once more before getting immersed in my career. Obviously, we've all had to make some sacrifices.

I am going back to school for computer science, and as much as I love it, I'm concerned that I shouldn't make the commitment yet. In the US as far as I'm concerned, it's standard to only get two weeks of vacation time a year. Seeing as how I am not expecting to travel any time soon, even with the vaccine being deployed, I'm so scared! Especially because if I don't get an internship this next summer, I'll have to get one the next. And then I should be ready to graduate, and a gap on my resume would look bad, I think.

I would love to become a digital nomad, but I don't know how realistic that is, especially since I haven't really honed my CS skills yet. I would also really love to move to another country, but I know how hard that is to do, too. Especially since English is my only language.

Any thoughts, advice, or similar feelings? Sorry if I sound whiney! Traveling and experiencing new places/ cultures is really what makes me feel happier to be alive. These past few months have been hard with nothing to look forward to.

solotravel,"I commented on someone's post about this but figured I'd make a whole post. I'm a huge fan of making friends while traveling and still keep in touch with random one-off friends I made in weird places. I think it's a special bond. Here are some ways I break the ice. 

**Note:** I've been on both sides of this as the lone traveler who has met and made friends with other solo travelers and groups, as well as the person in a group who has absorbed an orphan traveler into our group for the day/week. 

**These have worked for me:**

* **Wear or carry something distinctive, something that relates to your hobbies or passions.** I put stickers on literally everything and all my stickers relate to my hobbies/interests/bands/shows/books. So many people will stop and be like ""ahh, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sticker!"" or ""The Office!"" (even though everyone loves The Office, doesn't matter). Talking about *something* leads to talking about anything. More people than you realize want to make friends, they just feel weird as hell like you do. I live in Alaska so if I put something that says Alaska on it, people will inevitably comment on it **but** be wary of geographically identifiable clothing as it can make you a target as a tourist in less safe places.
* **Just ask people why they're traveling and where they're from.** Everyone thinks they're a grand explorer when they leave home and they're dying to talk about it.
* **Be interested in listening, don't feel pressured to talk.** Being interested is way more effective in making connections than being *interesting,* as people are more likely to want to hear your stories if they feel bonded to you and not like you're some weird stranger, vomiting your story all over them. So ask questions and actually listen, listening is super rare and always extremely appreciated.
* **Act open and excited, people are drawn to that shit.** Don't be weird, but don't be jaded. Sometimes anxiety can manifest as someone looking bored/disinterested, but nobody wants to have to pry someone out of their shell to get to know them. Be mindful of your paralanguage (non-verbals) and how closed-off you seem.
* **Practice trying new social techniques.** If you fuck it up and make it weird, you will literally never see them again and nothing matters. I've done some insanely awkward shit in the name of travel and while I didn't always make a lifelong friend, I definitely have some interesting stories.
* **Be open to new things.** Just because something doesn't sound fun, doesn't mean it can't lead to something fun. Sometimes I think we travel to distant lands just to do the same shit we do back home. Challenge yourself. Your routine will always be waiting for you back home. For example, I went motorbiking in Bermuda for the first time, it was scary as hell and my new friend broke her ankle and I accidently drove into a prison complex but did I have fun? Fuck yeah.
* **Don't wait for others to do a cool thing.** Do that cool thing and you will invariably find people there who do cool things. Your friends don't want to go to an Irish pub in motherfucking Ireland? Well guess what that pub is full of? People who want to be in Irish pubs. 
* **Take an active interest in the local culture.** Locals love sharing the regional drama, love being experts in their country, and delight in foreigners who aren't just there to see That One Tourist Destination. Most of them will complain about tourists, and that's half the fun. Like I said, in Alaska we joke about Tourist Hunting Season and complain about how our downtowns are flooded with outsiders every summer, but given the chance we will regale you with our crazy outdoor adventures and brag about how our cousin's ex-boyfriend was a crab fisher on season 3 of That Crab Fishing Show Whose Name I Can't Remember.
* **Don't be sloppy.** Nobody wants to hang out a second time with the dumpster person who got blackout and stuck their group with their tab.
* **Go on dates!** (if you're single, obvs) I've met some cool-ass people while traveling and swiping. As long as you're up front about your boundaries and what you're looking for, lots of locals are down for a one-off date and they probably know the ""cool local spot"" that they're excited to show you. I got roasted by Judah Friedlander at a comedy show on a date in NYC once. Probably wouldn't have known about it if my dated hadn't told me about that comedy show. 
* **Lastly, don't get stuck in your demographic.** Some of the coolest people I've met while traveling were way older. For example, when I was 26 I did shots in Iceland with a 65-year-old travel agent while her husband cheered us on and she still sends me periodic updates about her grandkids. Old people are cool as hell, hang out with them.

solotravel,"I love travelling. I've been solo traveling since I was in my twenties and actually prefer it because of the adventures I've had, though I look forward to including my partner one of these days. I'm really bummed right now, though about how unsafe and difficult it is to go anywhere, so I've been thinking about stories from the past. I wanted to share the experience that convinced me to keep solo traveling.

In 2007, I was a university student during a year abroad in Canterbury, England. On the advice of some people who had been in my program the year before, I decided not to go home, back to the states, for Christmas, but instead stay there and use the time for traveling. While most of my friends were going to Amsterdam for the legal pot, I had my heart set on going to Morocco because I wanted to experience Northern Africa, the first time I would be in a country where I was not the dominant race. I figured that it would be perfect to spend Christmas there since, as a predominantly Muslim country, I figured most business would be open through the season.

So, once classes were out for the winter break, I took a Ryanair flight over to Barcelona and spent a week in Spain before hoping on a bus from Madrid to the port city of Algeciras to catch the ferry over to Tangier.

Now about all that went as expected was I found where to purchase the tickets for my ferry and went over to the waiting area. I wasn't sure when the ferry would take off, but I figured it had to be soon. So I waited. And waited, And waited some more. I was there hours before it was time, evening slipped into night, and the waiting area was quickly filling up. I sat there until the wee hours of the morning, unsure when I was finally going to get to go but not terribly worried since I had no firm plans. Finally they started loading the boat, and I found myself on a cramped ferry and could only plop down on the floor in an empty space. I had no idea why so many people seemed to be trying to get to Morocco that night.

It was early the next morning, around 7:00 am by the time we got to Tangier. I was hungry and exhausted and really wanted to find a place to get some rest before continuing on down the coast the next day. As I was disembarking from the ferry, though, I was pulled aside, along with a few other people and had to wait for a rather gruff and unhappy looking customs officer to come talk to me. It turns out that the way customs works on this particular ferry is you get your passport stamped on the boat and then just show your passport as you disembark. There had been announcements but, because they were all in Spanish and Arabic, I didn't understand them. I was horrified and scared he was going to send me back to Spain but, after some questioning, he took out a stamp, stamped my passport, and sent me on my way.

I immediately realized something was up when I saw people literally on the street corners cooking goats. I would come to find out that, yes, I had escaped the Christian holidays in Britain, but my uncultured self forgot to check the Muslim calendar. I had arrived on Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest days on the Muslim calendar, and I was witnessing people out celebrating and preparing their feast. That's why there were so many people on my ferry. I started to panic: I knew I would be lucky that day to find a meal, much less lodging, that day.

I had picked out a pension, a small, cheap hotel, to stay in for the night, and found a taxi driver, who had no idea where it was. After driving around in circles, I asked him to drop me back off at the port, and then I realized the pension was only a block from the port on a pedestrian street. I walked up to the pension and stood at the front desk, exhausted, hungry, and more than a bit weary from the last twenty-four hours.

The owner of the pension walked up to the desk, a little surprised to see a customer at this time of the morning. I asked him if he had any rooms. Yes, he told me he did. I felt elated. For the first time this trip, something was going right.

""But I will not check you in!"" he told me. I looked at him, baffled. What was going on? Had I already offended him? Did I break some taboo without even knowing?

Sensing my confusion, he repeated, ""I will not check you in!"" He paused, looked at my face, and smiled. ""It is a holy day! I will not check you in until you have tea with me!""

It took me a moment to process what he'd just said. This man, who didn't know me, who had just met me, was asking me to have tea with him in honor of the Eid. I'd like to think he saw in my face a weary soul, way out of my element, and wanted to show me some kindness.

I did sit with him and with an Indian man I would find out was a regular at the pension. We talked about life. I told them my story as we had Moroccan mint tea with some bread and honey. I told them my story (the Indian man was briefly confused when I said I was from Indiana) and they told me theirs. We learned about one another that day. I also expressed my fear of not being able to find food on the Eid, and the owner reassured me.

""You are staying in my pension. You will eat tonight!""

I was overwhelmed by his generosity and, just before midday, crawled into a bed on the second floor, sleeping sounder than I had in ages.

That man is why I keep travelling. Travelling keeps reaffirming my belief that most people are basically good and want to be good people. His hospitality to a complete stranger who would have stayed at his pension even without it was so touching. I have since encountered generous, kind people in so many countries on multiple continents. The pension owner taught me that, even in a new country where I don't know the language or customs or traditions, even after a long, stressful day, there were people who could touch you and lift your spirits with a simple act of kindness.

I hope I'm half as good a person as that man.",Kindness to a Weary Moroccan Traveler,"I love travelling.

Now about all that went as expected was I found where to purchase the tickets for my ferry and went over to the waiting area. I wasn't sure when the ferry would take off, but I figured it had to be soon. So I waited. And waited, And waited some more. I was there hours before it was time, evening slipped into night, and the waiting area was quickly filling up. I sat there until the wee hours of the morning, unsure when I was finally going to get to go but not terribly worried since I had no firm plans. Finally they started loading the boat, and I found myself on a cramped ferry and could only plop down on the floor in an empty space. I had no idea why so many people seemed to be trying to get to Morocco that night.

It was early the next morning, around 7:00 am by the time we got to Tangier. I was hungry and exhausted and really wanted to find a place to get some rest before continuing on down the coast the next day. As I was disembarking from the ferry, though, I was pulled aside, along with a few other people and had to wait for a rather gruff and unhappy looking customs officer to come talk to me. It turns out that the way customs works on this particular ferry is you get your passport stamped on the boat and then just show your passport as you disembark. There had been announcements but, because they were all in Spanish and Arabic, I didn't understand them. I was horrified and scared he was going to send me back to Spain but, after some questioning, he took out a stamp, stamped my passport, and sent me on my way.

I immediately realized something was up when I saw people literally on the street corners cooking goats. I would come to find out that, yes, I had escaped the Christian holidays in Britain, but my uncultured self forgot to check the Muslim calendar. I had arrived on Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest days on the Muslim calendar, and I was witnessing people out celebrating and preparing their feast. That's why there were so many people on my ferry. I started to panic: I knew I would be lucky that day to find a meal, much less lodging, that day.

I had picked out a pension, a small, cheap hotel, to stay in for the night, and found a taxi driver, who had no idea where it was. After driving around in circles, I asked him to drop me back off at the port, and then I realized the pension was only a block from the port on a pedestrian street. I walked up to the pension and stood at the front desk, exhausted, hungry, and more than a bit weary from the last twenty-four hours.

The owner of the pension walked up to the desk, a little surprised to see a customer at this time of the morning. I asked him if he had any rooms. Yes, he told me he did. I felt elated. For the first time this trip, something was going right.

""But I will not check you in!"" he told me. I looked at him, baffled. What was going on? Had I already offended him? Did I break some taboo without even knowing?

Sensing my confusion, he repeated, ""I will not check you in!"" He paused, looked at my face, and smiled. ""It is a holy day! I will not check you in until you have tea with me!""

It took me a moment to process what he'd just said. This man, who didn't know me, who had just met me, was asking me to have tea with him in honor of the Eid. I'd like to think he saw in my face a weary soul, way out of my element, and wanted to show me some kindness.

I did sit with him and with an Indian man I would find out was a regular at the pension. We talked about life. I told them my story as we had Moroccan mint tea with some bread and honey. I told them my story (the Indian man was briefly confused when I said I was from Indiana) and they told me theirs. We learned about one another that day. I also expressed my fear of not being able to find food on the Eid, and the owner reassured me.

""You are staying in my pension. You will eat tonight!""

I was overwhelmed by his generosity and, just before midday, crawled into a bed on the second floor, sleeping sounder than I had in ages.

That man is why I keep travelling. Travelling keeps reaffirming my belief that most people are basically good and want to be good people. His hospitality to a complete stranger who would have stayed at his pension even without it was so touching. I have since encountered generous, kind people in so many countries on multiple continents. The pension owner taught me that, even in a new country where I don't know the language or customs or traditions, even after a long, stressful day, there were people who could touch you and lift your spirits with a simple act of kindness.

I hope I'm half as good a person as that man.Kindness to a Weary Moroccan Traveler",love travel travel sinc twenti actual prefer adventur though look forward includ partner one day realli bum right though unsaf difficult go anywher think stori past want share experi convinc keep travel univers student year abroad canterburi england advic peopl program year decid go home back state christma instead stay use time travel friend go amsterdam legal pot heart set go morocco want experi northern africa first time would countri domin race figur would perfect spend christma sinc predominantli muslim countri figur busi would open season class winter break took ryanair flight barcelona spent week spain hope bu madrid port citi algecira catch ferri tangier went expect found purchas ticket ferri went wait area sure ferri would take figur soon wait wait wait hour time even slip night wait area quickli fill sat wee hour morn unsur final go get go terribl worri sinc firm plan final start load boat found cramp ferri could plop floor empti space idea mani peopl seem tri get morocco night earli next morn around time got tangier hungri exhaust realli want find place get rest continu coast next day disembark ferri though pull asid along peopl wait rather gruff unhappi look custom offic come talk turn way custom work particular ferri get passport stamp boat show passport disembark announc spanish arab understand horrifi scare go send back spain question took stamp stamp passport sent way immedi realiz someth saw peopl liter street corner cook goat would come find ye escap christian holiday britain uncultur self forgot check muslim calendar arriv eid al adha one holiest day muslim calendar wit peopl celebr prepar feast mani peopl ferri start panic knew would lucki day find meal much less lodg day pick pension small cheap hotel stay night found taxi driver idea drive around circl ask drop back port realiz pension block port pedestrian street walk pension stood front desk exhaust hungri bit weari last twenti four hour owner pension walk desk littl surpris see custom time morn ask room ye told felt elat first time trip someth go right check told look baffl go alreadi offend break taboo without even know sens confus repeat check paus look face smile holi day check tea took moment process said man know met ask tea honor eid like think saw face weari soul way element want show kind sit indian man would find regular pension talk life told stori moroccan mint tea bread honey told stori indian man briefli confus said indiana told learn one anoth day also express fear abl find food eid owner reassur stay pension eat tonight overwhelm generos midday crawl bed second floor sleep sounder age man keep travel travel keep reaffirm belief peopl basic good want good peopl hospit complet stranger would stay pension even without touch sinc encount gener kind peopl mani countri multipl contin pension owner taught even new countri know languag custom tradit even long stress day peopl could touch lift spirit simpl act kind hope half good person man kind weari moroccan travel,1

Here’s a few of them: 

Egypt: 26 year old hotel manager in Cairo. Was upset I was dating another Egyptian guy. Bought me gifts, took me out to restaurants and an amazing day trip to the Red Sea. Had sex in my room twice. (All with protection of course) 

Dubai: half Emirati half Yemeni guy working at the check in desk. We flirted. After 3 days, brought me dinner to my room. Had sex. 

India: 22 year old Rajasthani guy who worked hard to become manager of hostel. Would flirt and bring me chai to my room every morning. He jumped into bed with me. 

Nepal: 28 year old upper class Nepali guy who’s parents owned 3 hotels. Took me on his motor bike to the most amazing restaurants and temples. Had sex twice in my room. When I left he slept in my bed for a week without changing the sheets. 

Kuwait: Syrian guy. Flirted for a while. Came to my room to watch tv. Took of his pants and asked if I like what I saw. I did. 

Tunisia: a guy my age working at the front desk. Took me around Carthage, trendy bars and restaurants. We took a road trip Down to the Sahara desert for the weekend. 

Morocco: Moroccan hotel manager who took me to all the souls in Marrakech and shared my bed for 2 nights

Cancun: head chef at resort from Vera Cruz. Cooked me amazing food and would come to my room after dinner service with a bottle of champagne

solotravel,"Hey everyone how's it going ?


If it wasn't for a certain pandemic I would be eagerly awaiting my solo trip to Peru and Bolivia which isn't going to happen anytime soon so I thought might as well plan my future bucket lists when international travel is allowed again. 


Now I know in this day and age there really isn't any truly 'uncharted' territory left and everything has been discovered and if its worth doing I wont be the first one there nor will I be the last. I mean if you really wanted to you can even book a trip to both the North and South pole or even climb Mt Everest (for a heavy price). 

I've been to Nepal for EBC and Tanzania for Mt Kili and although they are both extremely popular tourist destinations far from being 'uncharted' or 'off the beaten path' they still gave me the feeling of being a 'adventurer' in a 'unknown world' 


So I'm pretty much after locations/destinations that gave you the feeling like you are in the unknown wilderness far from civilisation and completely untouched or forgotten by humanity. Essentially if the destination or journey made you feel like the explorers and adventures of old I definitely want to hear about it !

solotravel,"Hey y'all, I've been inspired by this subreddit to plan my first solo international trip for next summer and was wondering if anyone with experience in these places could help clarify a few specific things for me or at least point me in the right direction. 

My first question is that I plan to stay in a lot of rifugios/mountain huts in Italy and the swiss alps and I notice some websites say to ""bring your own sleeping bag""... Does that mean like an actual sleeping bag you'd bring camping/backpacking or something else? Because I also notice from pictures that the beds have a folded blanket on top of them. Also for rifugio locatelli's reservation page, it gives me the option of ""beds with bed linen (in 2,3,4 bed rooms) or mattress storage"" for accommodation type and I can't figure out what the difference is between those.

My other question is regarding parking at tre cime to stay at that rifugio. In my current plan, I would arrive there by car in the afternoon, like around 2 or 3pm, but I've seen the internet say that the parking lot fills up by 10am. I assume people continually leave throughout the day so is it ACTUALLY possible that I could be blocked out from parking up there that day, even with an overnight reservation up there?

My first question is that I plan to stay in a lot of rifugios/mountain huts in Italy and the swiss alps and I notice some websites say to ""bring your own sleeping bag""... Does that mean like an actual sleeping bag you'd bring camping/backpacking or something else? Because I also notice from pictures that the beds have a folded blanket on top of them. Also for rifugio locatelli's reservation page, it gives me the option of ""beds with bed linen (in 2,3,4 bed rooms) or mattress storage"" for accommodation type and I can't figure out what the difference is between those.

solotravel,"One of my favourite things about solo travel is the fact that it forces you to go outside your comfort zone. It's a lot easier to say yes to things you wouldn't usually do and this can result in the most insane/hilarious/scary/incredible things happening which are often some of the best memories of trips away. 

The one annoying thing I've found though, is when I get home and I'm telling people about my trip. I can sometimes tell that some of my friends think I'm bullshitting them with Walter Mitty-esque tales. It doesn't bother me too much but it's sometimes frustrating when I'm being honest but I don't have someone to corroborate my story. 

With that in mind, and with the promise that I'll believe your story no matter how insane it might sound, what is the most unbelievable event (or events) that has actually happened to you on your travels?

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice as far as motorcycle traveling goes.

solotravel,"I don't necessarily mean it in a sinister way. Just like... the most odd/BIZARRE (not OLD 🙃). 

I was in one of the Budapest Party hostels about 5 years ago and one of the other solo travellers there was obsessed with chess. Would only talk about chess. Commandeered the hostel chess set and went from group to group trying to play it with every guest. Absolutely dominated all of them. After the win, he would move on without saying much. 

On my last day there, I was his lucky chosen one. We started playing. I'm shit at chess. He took my queen after 5 or so moves. 

At this point one of the staff announces that anyone coming on the hostel organised day trip has 10 minutes to meet at the reception before they head off. Mr Chess must have reserved a place on this trip because he was getting noticeably nervous and prompting me to hurry up everytime it was my turn. I was getting destroyed so I of course purposefully slowed down. 

The ten minutes passed and he had to leave. Our match was far from over and he was freaking out. He insisted that we took a picture of the board and continued where we left off when he returned. He then quickly shovelled all the chess pieces into the box and brought the chess set with him on the day trip. 

After they left, I packed my stuff and moved on to Croatia. 

I often think about him and wonder if I was the only person he didn't beat on his trip.

solotravel,"Hello , 

I am traveling in Egypt for last 2 weeks of December.  I am flying in to Cairo and flying out of Sharm. My plan in this trip is to start with Cairo , see the ruins and know the history. Make my way south to Luxor and then across east to Dahab. Probably make a stop in Sharm for a night or dive there.  This is my tentative plan but I am open to suggestion. 

I have been doing my research but I would like opinion from people who have traveled to Egypt or know the country the following things. 

* Guides - I feel guide is important as there is so much history related to this place. I am not sure who i can hire them for a day or two. Would like to get a reliable source. 
* Tips - Looks like Egypt has a tipping culture ( atleast on the tourist sites) , I saw on the video's that people would expect tips if they help you take pictures or in transportation. Is it a must to tip ? how much would you tip ? I have no problem tipping in restaurants or for a cab , but for a picture ? Please let me know. 
* Covid - What is covid situation is Egypt ? I do not see much info online. Not that I am going to cancel the trip now  but any information will be helpful 

Places visiting 

* Cairo 
* Luxor / Aswan (may be)
* Dahab

Travel 

I am planning to travel in bus/train in between the cities. Will be taking ferry to Sharm. Does any one know if they are on operation ? One of the video I checked said it only runs/floats , during the peak season. Apparently this is a peak season , but we are all aware of the condition now. 

Interest in Egypt

* Culture 
* History 
* Diving

solotravel,"I am a Bangladeshi national planning a trip to Turkey at some point next year when things get better. Because I have a valid US visa I qualify for the e-visa, but this (image) is the only option that I qualify for (30 day single entry valid for the next 180 days, starting from when I apply)

I am wondering if I can stay in Turkey for 30 days, leave and go to Georgia/Egypt/Balkans and come back a month later with a new e-visa? Or will I not be allowed to reapply until the 180 day period for the original one isn't over. If the latter is the case, I would apply for my visa 4-5 months ahead of my trip and time my trip just right, so I can leave for a month, wait out the ending of the 180 day period and re-enter with a new e-visa application.

solotravel,"  Hi Everyone, 

 Scott's Cheap Flights delivered once again! $650 USD tickets to Nairobi. Now this was pretty was spontaneous so I still have a lot of planning to do but you guys are really great with recommendations so I'll start here. Would love your recommendations, tips, tricks, must sees for Nairobi:

Interest: Mostly outdoor, camping, hiking, whitewater, beach, mountains, wildlife, art, Avant Gard, weird stuff, cooking

Length – Friday to following Saturday (9 days)

Budget – Would like to be as frugal as possible but willing to spend for the big experiences (treks, safari, flights, tours, etc). I anticipate either renting a car or hoping on a regional flight at some point for a few days outside of Nairobi. I can sleep anywhere that is safe and hope to camp at some point as well (either alone or with a tour). I prefer hostels over AirBnB or hotels if possible.

Other Considerations: I only speak English, I can read and understand French at a beginner level. I don’t know how to drive stick shift. I have experience travelling solo in Mexico, Slovenia, Barcelona, and USA. 

Questions on Car Rentals: Are there any surprises? Like in Mexico where the rental is $5 a day but the mandatory insurance is $500. 

Currency?: Should I expect local cash exchanges only or can I use my travel credit card?

Ideally, I imagine a few days in the capital and then the rest of the time travelling around Kenya via car, or possibly getting on a plan and travelling to somewhere else in the region. Flights to the continent of Africa are usually $1200+ in my area so I want to take advantage of the opportunity.

I really want to go start seeing them at some point, I have a super strong urge to just travel all over Europe this upcoming Spring (provided lockdown is over by then of course). However, I have some conditions that I think will make this quite hard. The big one is that I have a form of ASD and therefore can be prone to panic and being overwhelmed in unfamiliar environments. To add to this, I can sometimes have extreme difficulties in socialising because of it, although this has become much less of a problem in recent years. But a few years back when I was travelling in the UK on my own, I ended up having something of a total breakdown and have been put off going abroad ever since.

I am not at all experienced with travelling abroad, with the exception of a few days in Paris on a high school trip over five years ago lol.

So, due COVID cancellations I have a bunch of carrier flight points to use in the US and wanted to spend 1-2 months in the country. Never been to the US before and I am planning to rely on buses and my bike to travel around as much as I can.

Thing is, this would be my first international bike trip, and my first time in the US. I would land in JFK and cycle down Washington and then Virginia. Then rely on buses around Southern US (I plan to go to Texas visit a friend). My trip would end in Grand Canyon, then taking another transportation to get a flight back home from California.

I need to understand the logistics to carry the bike case and panniers, and also how much is feasible to travel around the country using my bike and buses. How much does it cost to carry this stuff in int. flights? Can I put my case in travel buses in the US? Also, is it dangerous to do solo cycletourism in the US?

I plan to do it once it's not too hot and I'm vaccinated, so perhaps during the Fall. Meaning I have a little less than a year to figure this all out and plan my trip.

TL;DR

In my early/mid twenties from USA and will have about 3.5k to spend on a 3 week trip. Trying to decide between: South East Asia, Japan, or Europe 
Or if you have any other recs plz lmk!

Just a little background, I did my first ever backpacking trip with a friend from college in Europe for ~ 1 month. It was fantastic, but honestly my favorite part of the trip was when we split up for about a week (no drama or anything, he just went to see family) and i got to experience staying in a hostel by myself and planning all my own activities. I was so surprised at how easy it was to meet people and felt so free not having to plan around someone else!

That was about 1.5 years ago(summer 2019, I know, we got so lucky we got that trip in before all this happened) and honestly, ever since then I’ve been dreaming about my next trip (solo) and saving for it. So far I have about 2.5k saved for a trip and am planning to save another 1k in the coming year. So ~3.5k in total is my budget

After I get the vaccine and travel is back to normal I’m thinking I’m going to take 3 weeks off work either 4th quarter 2021 or early 2022.

Looking for recommendations on where I should go. I’ve heard South East Asia is really good for first time solo travelers and has an established backpacker infrastructure but the only place I’m really interested in so far would be Thailand. I imagine 3 weeks would be too much time in one country but lmk if you think otherwise or have any other recommendations in SEA.

I’ve also always been fascinated with Japan and really want to visit Tokyo/Osaka. However I know that not much English is spoken and I worry it would be a little too much for a first time solo trip. Also Japan will be there and maybe better for when I am older (in early/mid twenties rn)

And my last thought is to go back to Europe and go to some of the countries I skipped/really liked. Portugal and Spain. Or maybe go with the northern route. I did really like Europe!

I know this is pretty vague and I’m super fortunate to have still been employed and be able to save this amount for a trip. Any recommendations would be helpful on those 3 I talked about or honestly if you have an entirely different place I hadn’t thought about please do tell!!!
And do you think 3.5k is a good budget for 3 weeks? Or if that is that overkill, I could always spend less and save the rest for my next solo trip down the line.

I am surprisingly technologically inept for being a millennial, so my absolute number one requirement would be convenience and a hassle-free experience.  Essentially, I want to step off the airplane and have my phone work normally as it would at home.

Through my research I am currently leaning towards Google Fi, it seems to be the easiest to use and also works immediately in most countries.

solotravel,"I realized I haven't traveled much domestically, so would love any suggestions for destinations and journeys in the US for a solo female traveler. Some considerations:

- I’ve lived in large East Coast cities (NYC/Boston/DC), and in general, would like to avoid spending too much time in very large cities like LA etc. I’m thinking more like smaller cities (e.g. New Orleans or Portland, ME) or non-cities.

- Length: 2-3 weeks.

- I'd love to see as much of the country I can by train, like how people buy an Interrail/Eurail pass to see Europe. I can’t drive, and while flying is an option, I’d ideally want scenic views during the journey.

- Budget: I’m unsure about this, so estimates would be helpful. I’ve saved up and was thinking around $4k, and while obviously the less the better, I’m willing to go up a bit if that seems unrealistic. I’m not seeking luxury, but want to be reasonably comfortable and safe.

- Interests: Food is super important, I don’t care where I get it from as long as it’s delicious; no dietary restrictions, and am very open to trying new foods. I also love to just walk around, surrounded by beautiful scenery or interesting architecture. Not as interested in museums or nightclubs.

- Safety: I’m a woman of color, so yeah, while I wish this were an irrelevant fact, anything that minimizes my risk of sexual assault/racism would be great.

Thanks in advance!

solotravel,"That's what's been happening to me this week! I've been nonstop reading through posts on this subreddit, looking through my old travel blog/photos, researching plane tickets, visa requirements and so on.... I think being all cooped up in quarantine is giving me even more travel-lust

So as a result I decided to plan on my next big trip! In March of 2023, I will have been at my current job for three years and will have certainly saved up more than enough to take a year off for solotravel. I plan on giving my notice and then starting my travels in May of that year. Here is my loose itinerary:

# PART 1: THE MEDITERRANEAN, EASTERN &amp; CENTRAL EUROPE

**May:** Fly to Israel via Birthright. Since I'm Jewish I can go on an all-expenses-paid 10 day trip to Israel. The catch is it's not solotravel because I'll be with a group, and also I'm really not a Zionist, but hey it's a free plane ride to the middle east. After the trip is over I plan on hoping over to Istanbul where I'll spend the rest of the month couchsurfing and exploring the city

**June:** Start moving westward. I'd like to check out Sofia and Athens. Maybe I'll find a workaway/helpx program to join for a few weeks

**July**: Work my way up the Adriatic Sea and check out Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.

**August:** Head to Budapest and spend 2-3 weeks there. This was my favorite city when I did my very first solotrip in 2012 and I always wish I could have spent more than just a few days there. Towards the end of the month, I'll start working my way north into Slovakia and then Poland where I'd like to pay my respects at a concentration camp.

**September:** Head to Berlin, where I'll spend most of the month couchsurfing or helpxing. I have some friends there from my 2016 SEA trip I'd like to reconnect with!

# PART 2: THE HIMALAYAS &amp; SOUTH ASIA

**October:** With the cold weather approaching in Europe, it'll be time to change things up! I plan on flying from Berlin to Kathmandu to spend a month trekking. I hear this is the best time of year as the monsoon will have just ended

**November:** India! After I'm done trekking I'd like to check out Delhi and Rajasthan. As usual I'll be couchsurfing, helpxing and staying in hostels

**October:** Start working my way further south and spend a good chunk of time in Mumbai

**November:** Continue southward and spend time in Goa

**December:** Explore the southern tip of India I guess? I honestly have no idea what's even there and what to expect but why not!

**January:** Sri Lanka! I think I could spend a month here

**February:** If at this point I've had enough of South Asia, I'd like to check out Japan for a month before heading back home (big bucketlist item is to stay in a capsule hotel). I'm thinking a couple weeks in Tokyo, a couple weeks exploring rural japan.

**March:** Pit stop in Costa Rica to see some family and then head back to the USA to begin job hunting and piecing my life back together!

solotravel,"Hey!

So I've traveled to a few places before and stayed at hostels. However this has been mainly in Western Europe and Japan. Japan is extremely safe and I feel comfortable walking home with someone I met at the hostel completely shit faced at 2 in the morning. The same goes for European countries where I know what I'm doing. Of course there is always a safety risk but I see the risk as quite low. But here comes my problem: in poorer places or just places that are not as safe, how do you go out? I'm asking this because I'm currently in Colombia but I'm too afraid to do anything. I'll go out during the day and explore but avoid the bad areas (again being very cautious) and have an early dinner and stay at the hostel. I'm afraid to go out in to the dark streets of Colombia and go drinking somewhere. If we are in a big group I'll go out but avoid having more than a beer. I constantly read stories here about people going out and drinking,doing drugs etc. This is what I like and what I want but don't dare to. This question is not Colombia specific, I'm asking about all countries that wouldn't be considered ""very safe"", so even countries in SEA like Vietnam or Thailand.   


So, how do you guys do it? Maybe I'm too cautious since I avoid many situations even during daytime while alone exploring. But then again, I don't want to get robbed or worse, injured in any way.   


All responses are very appreciated!","How to go out in ""riskier"" countries?","Hey!

solotravel,"Seeking feedback on a planned solo trip to Greece 2021, COVID situation dependent.

I’m primarily interested in hiking/exploring with bars and music at night. Beaches are nice, but swimming not a focus on this one. 

I’m date flexible, but trying to balance good weather (not a fan of overcast) and meeting other travelers with beating the stampede. 

Tentative schedule

May 4/5th: USA -&gt; Athens (get in 10pm)

May 6th or 7th: -&gt; Rhodes

(Possible ferry to Fethiye/Bodrum In here)

May 12th: -&gt; Crete

May 16th: -&gt; Athens

May 17th: Delphi day trip

May 18th: -&gt; USA 

# Date questions 

1. Is this too early weather wise? I’m under the impression that Rhodes especially, but also Crete will likely have sunny weather, and great temp for hikes. But would bumping to mid/end of May be wise? 
2. Likewise, from a seasonal perspective. I know COVID adds uncertainty here, but should stuff mostly be open by early May? Will anyone be around? As a solo, I certainly don’t want to be in a ghost town.

# Crete vs Paros/Naxos 
My first choice is probably Paros/Naxos instead of Crete since it’s so huge and intimidating with the limited time I have. I also like being able to day trip from Paros to Naxos for hiking (and possibly Santorini). However, I’m under the impression Crate should be much more active by early May than Paros/Naxos and much easier to get to from Rhodes. Is this likely the case? Is it worth pushing to mid/end May and switch to Paros?

# Turkey
Is it worth making time to hit Fethiye or Bodrum from Rhodes? Especially if I can extend the trip by a few days? I’d really like to do it, assuming the ferries will be running at that time, and it won’t be a headache. 

I’ve been reading a ton of info online about solo traveling Greece, but I’d love any advice anyone can give about where and when to go. And tips for Solo in the Greece islands.

solotravel,"*Preface as to where I'm at with school and how I feel about jobs-* 

I’m a junior in high school and coming to terms with the fact that I have an entire life ahead of me independent from my parents. I have to make something of my life. I have to find fulfillment and happiness, and at the same time be self sufficient. There are an inconceivable amount of possibilities yet I have to hone down on a singular path. I have to take a first step and I don’t exactly know what it should be. 

School has been a mess and I have absolutely zero passion or interest in any class I’ve taken. I suppose some aspects of literature and history have been interesting here and there, but the work revolving around anything related to school is so draining. It’s incredibly hard to motivate myself to do homework or to study and I can’t imagine pursuing an actual career related to the subjects I’ve stumbled across. The thought of being rooted in one place pursuing some career in whatever field my college degree happens to be in sounds horrible. 

There’s something about tasks that require lots of thinking where I’m expected to meet a deadline that doesn’t click with me. Writing essays, studying calculus, reading about cellular respiration, and anything in between is incredibly hard. I just can’t focus on it. I have a much easier, relaxing time doing mundane, physical tasks like mowing a lawn or stocking shelves than I do complex tasks that require deeper thought. Maybe it’s like this for everyone, but I guess I don’t have the stamina or willpower for it. It’s too hard and too stressful. If I’m going to have to work to make money I’d rather it be something easy than it be something hard. 

I’m content with the thought of working a low paying, low skill job for the rest of my life. I feel it's wishful thinking to believe there’s a sizable chance I’ll find a job that I enjoy doing, and I’m sure most people end up not liking the job they get stuck with. Might as well cut my losses rather than try to grasp at something that’s not there.

*Travel related part-*

This leads me to my issue. There is an abundance of trades that pay relatively well, or even just jobs managing the local walmart or whatever, but anything in the states just sounds boring and depressing. Living in the same town for years on end is boring. The world genuinely interests me and I want to explore it. I want to travel, and not the sight-seeing vacation type, but just experience everything. I wanna be able to settle down in any old European town and live there until I grow bored of it and wish to seek a new culture or landscape. I don’t care for the materialistic side of things like having a nice home or nice cars. As long as I have my basic necessities covered and I’m not homeless I’m sure I’ll be fine. 

The problem is I don’t know if it’s possible to pick up jobs in foreign countries, especially if I’m not fluent in the language. I don’t know if I’ll just be able to show up in a city and find employment relatively quickly. Maybe I will need to settle down someplace in the states and work to save money by living below my means so that I can afford to travel the world X amount of months out of every year. 

It’s so overwhelming and I’m having trouble articulating my thoughts. I really do just want to go out and explore the world, live my life in the moment. I don’t want to be tied down with a family driving my kids to soccer every weekend, working my 9-5 so that I can pay the mortgage on my house in the suburb and put food on the table. I’m just scared I’m gonna graduate and go move to Europe with 10,000 dollars in my bank account, stay for a month unable to find employment and end up on the streets with nowhere to go. Maybe I should get a college degree so I have something to default on. I just want to live this nomadic lifestyle and experience what there is to experience, but I don’t know where to start. I don’t even know if it’s possible. I’m not even sure this entire rant even makes sense, but I’d appreciate any advice or insight.","I'm lost.

I've travelled for 2 years in a row now to Belgium and Germany for the days between 26th Dec to 31st - usually non eventful days off for me anyway so I just go on a quick trip to Europe. 

For me, I actually enjoy going for a quick trip during those times, its very quiet as you would expect, but to me its actually nice to walk around and see the sights in peace away from large crowds.

Its ironic as well because I feel the 'Christmas spirit' more so when I am away from home, maybe due to the extremely cold winter and the chance to drink gluhwein or whatever haha.

solotravel,"I've just recently started to pick up watercolor as a stress relief hobby. I used to paint for fun in school, but stopped over a decade ago--losing all my penmanship and dexterity since I only use my hands for typing these days. I'm just starting to relearn everything, but really liking it so far. 



I like the idea of plein air painting. I love the quiet people-watching moments that solo travel allows, when you have all the time in the world to sit and soak in the ambiance. Usually I just absent-mindedly drink some coffee and leave when I'm done, but I figure plein air painting would be a great way to really appreciate my environment and commit it to memory. There's been so many instances solo traveling where I want to soak in my environment and have an excuse to sit around for an hour lol. 


Does anyone else paint on the road? If so, what are your supplies? Do you have any advice or recommendations? I've bought one of those mini tins that can cram 18 watercolour half pans, but I'm looking for small brushes and other mini equipment that won't take up much space. I'm into minimalist travel, and it'd be great if I could find supplies to fit in small spaces for backpack-less day trips (eg with a small fanny pack or crossbody purse).

I'm planning a 4 months long euro trip and having some troubles regarding the vehicle which I'll use.

At first I was considering buying a cheap 2nd hand car but as it turns out, it's quite problematic in Spain where I will begin the trip.
I'm now looking at the option of renting a car and I'm having a hard time finding a cheap long-term car rental deal.

Looking for a car with a lot of luggage space (such as the 'Citroen Berlingo') and preferably the option to drop off at a different location than where I pick it up.

solotravel,"I was on a plane from Tangier to Rome seated next to a very sweet old lady wearing a hijab. She spoke no English, and I speak no Arabic nor Spanish, though between us we made a little headway with our equally shaky French and plenty of friendly gesticulating.

At some point in the flight I realised I smelled very much like a smelly backpacker. So, when I had to go to the bathroom, I took my roll-on with me to freshen up a bit out of consideration for my friendly seatmate. I was in the plane’s toilet cubicle and there wasn’t much left in the roll-on bottle (one of those Nivea ones with the thick gel-liquid-stuff) so I shook it to get it the dregs to go onto the ball.

Horrifyingly, the ball popped off the end of the bottle (which has *never ever* happened to me before) and the fucking deodorant flung out in a slash all over the mirror, basin and my jeans. The deodorant gel was white, not clear, so I started panicking and thinking “I have GOT to get this off my pants.” I tried wiping it with toilet paper but that just pilled and made grains of toilet paper stick to my leg and crotch in an incriminating blotchy white line.

It definitely looked as bad as it looked. I’d been in the bathroom for ages at that point and eventually had to head back to my seat with a long white stain down the groin and left leg of my black skinny jeans. There was nothing discrete about my re-entry and my new friend refused to gesticulate with me for the rest of the trip. Shame – a lost opportunity.

solotravel,"Hey solotravel!

With news of the vaccine being great across the board (so far and fingers crossed), I am starting to look to Europe for a long awaited solo trip. I am specifically planning a trip **around the UK in the June for a little over a month** and I am curious of everybody's thoughts around here on the details of my trip, specifically from a solo traveler perspective because I'll be totally alone for basically all of this and I figure folks around here have done similar trips in the past.

I am an American and I have never been to the UK (only been to Europe once as a high schooler in Italy), so I am a noob across the board. But I really want to see a bunch of stuff. 

**Here's my trip outline:**

* **London** - June 2nd-June 7th (**4 full days** in London, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Liverpool** - June 7th-June 10th (**1 full day** in Liverpool, 1 day trip to Manchester, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Edinburgh** - June 10th-June 15th (**4 full days in Edinburgh**, 1 day trip to Loch Lomond, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Glasgow** - June 16th-June 20th (**3 full days in Glasgow**, two travel days in/out)
* **Belfast** - June 20th-June 23rd (**2 full days in Belfast**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Dublin** - June 23rd-June 25th (**2 full days in Dublin**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Birmingham** - June 26th-July 2nd (**3 full days in Birmingham**, 1 day trip to Oxford, 1 day trip to Cambridge, 2 travel days in/out)
* **London** - July 2nd-July 6th (**3 full days in London, 2 travel days in/out)**

When I say travel in/out I basically mean half days where traveling is the priority, so for that first London date I'd be flying in on the 2nd and leaving for Liverpool on the morning of the 7th.

Are there any stops on here that are way too long? I don't need to be go-go-go for every part of this trip, I wouldn't mind relaxing here and there. I tried to build that rest into some of the Birmingham time because I figure I'll be a bit worn out by then, and that town is centrally located and low key so I thought it'd be good for day trips and rest. Again I'm alone so I'm really just into museums and nature and wandering around.

I plan on using trains to get around for the most part, though I have become aware that renting a car may be easier for an American than I originally thought. So we'll see on that!

Does anything stick out as red flags on this trip? I'm really just looking for general thoughts and reactions from seasoned travelers. I appreciate any feedback! Obviously, this is all COVID contingent, so here's hoping that the vaccine distribution is successful across the world.

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for all of the advice so far! It sounds like the consensus is for sure that it is too city heavy right now and that I should lean more towards smaller towns and countrysides. I think I am going to take that to heart for sure. The other advice is that Ireland and Northern Ireland are worth doing separately and I think I am starting to agree with that. Also I'm impressed only one person corrected that Dublin is not in the UK haha, I know that but looking at the map it made for an easy loop around. I understand it's a whole different place though.

I'm starting to think that I will reduce the number of nights in the cities and do some research on specific spots across the mainland that would be a bit smaller/more nature focused. I'm also thinking that if this does go on to be the first leg in a greater European trip, maybe I can round out the trip in Ireland at the end and spend more time outside of its cities.

solotravel,"I feel like it was a fail cause I ended up chickening out. Basically I booked this Airbnb which wasn’t far from where I live to go hiking by myself. When I got there it was like middle of nowhere and tbh I was immediately uncomfortable because there were a bunch of White supremacists signs on a few peoples homes in the area. But since I already paid for everything i decided to stay. The Airbnb was pretty nice and relaxing with a view of the lake. Then I went out to the hiking trail. I kinda got lost and my car was not suitable for the terrain so I had to leave it. I started walking to the trail it was bright and sunny but a little cold. I did see a few older people on the trail. For some reason I felt really uncomfortable being alone. I just couldn’t do it and turned back. 

I went back to the Airbnb. Basically I ordered food got some wine, watched Home Alone and went to sleep. The next morning I left my trip early and went home. I don’t know why but I just was feeling really sad. I’ve always wanted to do this and it just didn’t work out. I’ve always went on trips with people (family, friends, former partners, etc) this was supposed to be my first solo trip and it just sucked. My anxiety, depression and stuff since my breakup really messed with my head 

I’m gonna try again and research better next time. But anyway, i know this wasn’t really traveling since it was only a short road trip away.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the support. Really makes me feel better about the whole situation. I forgot to mention the dog at the Airbnb! He was super adorable and a really large dog.

So, as the vaccine news draws in I’m getting really excited about travel &amp; want to do a long, big solo trip as soon as it’s possible. Im hoping next autumn, like September or October of 2021. I’ve been debating between Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe. I’ve planned both out, but I’m not sure which to do first! Doing them back to back would be great, but I don’t think I would have the money to make it work. 

For SEA im hoping to spend 4-6 months there going through Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore &amp; Malaysia.

For Eastern Europe I would be hoping to spend 4ish months going through Slovenia, Albania. Croatia, Slovakia, Romania, Greece, Ukraine, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro &amp; Hungary.

Another option would be working as an English teacher in France from Oct 2021-May 2022, then going backpacking from there, but I think I would have a lot less money if I did that, so am kind of considering putting it on the back burner.

I can continue down this path and live a life of comfort and stability, which I can build upon with family and friends and no doubt will I be happy, as I understand these are luxuries are not provided to all who walk this world but there's still a part of me that yearns for something different. I think this comes from my past of traveling doing three separate solo travel trips. These trips have certainly impacted my life and made me less reliant on physical items for happiness and more on experiences which goes against the capitalist system that we as humans are forced to live within, so I guess my questions lies there. I assume most travellers live with the ideology of experiences over materialism, but how are we to cope with life when reality by all accounts forces us down a path of capitalism and conformity?

solotravel,"Howdy, everyone. 

Does anyone have any advice for not feeling guilty about traveling solo while you’re partnered?

I discovered solo travel after a manipulative and emotionally abusive relationship, and it’s truly become a part of who I am.  My longest trips have been 3 weeks in Southeast Asia and 4 weeks in Portugal and Spain.  I love seeing the world and connecting with my inner-most self.

I’m lucky to be in a secure and loving relationship, now, and my partner embraces, supports, and actually encourages my solo travel.  It feels weird, to be honest!

(As an aside, we also travel together and I enjoy it, but solo travel is still my favorite.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for combating that guilty feeling?  I feel like I “should” want to travel with him more than I want to travel solo (even though I know this is a cognitive distortion and I’m lucky to have a partner that gets it that solo travel is part of my DNA).

I have my first international solo trip coming up on May 8-16 in Tulum. Fingers crossed the virus is in a much better place by then. 

I am trying to come up with a rough itinerary on things to do and places to stay. 

I will have a rental car the entire 8 days. 

My MAIN question that is killing me, has to do with additional excursions that aren’t the easiest to do. 

I’m trying to decide if I want to take a ferry to Cozumel on my arrival day and spend 1 night there before getting to Tulum. And my second question is do I want to drive all the way down to Punta Allen and do I want to stay a night there? 

If the trip to Cozumel is suggested I was thinking of leaving my rental car in Playa del Carmen and renting a Classic Beetle to drive around the island for the day. 

The type of activities I am looking to do are more adventurous and seeing nature than spending a week on the beach. I will probably spend 1 maybe 2 days on the actually beach. 

Certain things I’m specifically looking at doing are the river float in Sian Ka’an. Going to Cenotes. A group dinner experience. Seeing Mayan ruins. Snorkeling with the sea turtles. 

I’m thinking of staying in a mix of hotels and hostels, this would be my first time ever staying at a hostel. 

And I’m very excited to try some amazing food.

solotravel,"Hi guys, This is a bit of a weird question.  
I would love to experience traveling throughout the Middle East.  
My only concern is **my birth name is Israel**. I'm 100% Australian, no real connection to Israel as a country or any religious ties. (Not that it should matter anyway)  


I've heard there are quite a few countries that don't have the greatest relations with Israel.  
This begs the question, As someone whose name would be closely related to the country of Israel - Would I have any problems in certain Middle Eastern countries?  


As someone who loves all cultures, religions, and people I would absolutely love to travel to almost all of the middle eastern countries but can't shake this weird feeling I might encounter some troubles.  


(for reference, in Australia and almost every country i've been to when i mention my name people generally assume/ask if im Israeli, Muslim or Jewish)

Been in Sweden (swede so duh), Copenhagen, Paris, London, Brussels, Gdansk and Warsaw, Rome, Naples and Pisa, Athens, Vienna and Zagreb but I always feel like I'm still in Europe :/

Nowadays though there are many websites like airbnb where you can book a photoshoot in the place you're travelling to. Have you ever taken one? 

i hate looking back on a trip and not have a ""decent""  pic to show my family or friends.

Most of the time i've take them on a tripod with a self timer and they turn out okay, but i don't always feel safe to do so. It's always a risk putting your phone or expensive camera on a tripod and stand far away from it to take a picture. Anybody could snatch it off in a matter of seconds.

Personally when I solo travel, I pretty much have eyes in the back of my head.

solotravel,"While we shouldn't be out travelling during the pandemic so what's there to do other than sharing our brainbloopers and learning from them perhaps.


I've shared this mistake in another thread with similar theme, but oh what a costly error of thinking. 

I was finally travelling home from Southeast Asia after spending a month in Vietnam. I didn't book a flight home as I had no specific deadline other than a loosely set date. 


Browsed the web on my phone, found a reasonable price - a bit late in the night 00:10, but to save money I'm no stranger to travelling late, can even sleep on the flight so not even a bad choice after all.


So here's the fuck up, I booked the flight home for 25th of June, 00:10. Not optimal with checkout times but I figured I would just travel a day early to get closer to the airport, check into a cheap hostel. So I did, checked out from the hotel and booked a taxi to the hostel. Had a day to rest out and do literally nothing. I arrived at the airport the 25th of June around 21:50, ready for a long flight.


Made my way to the lists of flights and gates that's continously updated. Stood there like a dumb fuck staring, looking for my flight for atleast 5 minutes. Waiting to see if the rolling list was just playing a trick on my mind, making me miss my specific flight.


Eventually when looking down at my phone and checking my flight reservation I realized I had missed my fucking flight. It's about to hit 26th of June 00:10. Not only did I miss it, but I missed it by an entire day.


After sighing internally and declaring myself dumb for another solid 5 minute which felt like an hour I quickly began looking up new flights. Instead of paying 550 euros back home I'm now paying 700 euro, and not until the day after. But I'm a belief of the you live and you learn, plus I'm not by any means rich but I'm not poor either so I always budget for major fucks up like this even if it did sting like a bitch.


**tl:dr** Booked flight for 25th of June 00:10, thought this meant I could go to the airport the 25hth of June close to midnight and make my flight but obviously it's about to be 26th of June.

solotravel,"Hi all,

As the title suggests, I’m planning a trip to Central Asia and the Caucasus for the future.

As I would be in the regions in spring, from March - June, that precipitates the need for good footwear. I have a pair of Eccos for walking and cities, but need a second option. 

Deciding between a hiking shoe, trail runner, and sneaker. Obviously all have their own plaudits, but my main concern is use outside of the mountains and grinding down the logs on asphalt or concrete. That said, if much of the land is going to be gravel, mud, or glass, it would be better to have more stable footwear.

Has anyone spent time in either region and can recommend a direction?

solotravel,"Well here's my rant for the month, not really a question. I fucking hate this pandemic, and I hate being stuck domestic, but there's a tiny silver lining for me anyway. 

About a year ago,  I took my first solo trip and never looked back on whether or not I'd like the idea. I was less than a year into really moving on from domestic travel (been to most cool cities in the US) to primarily going abroad. I did as many countries in 2019 as I had in my life prior. I had a cushy remote job, which meant workations on top of good salary and paid vacations. 

Then 2 days before I am supposed to leave for Colombia, borders shut down. 

Slowly but surely I started forgetting (or becoming a bit numb to) what I loved about travel and why, I got used to not seeing and hopping on flight deals I find just because. The unknowns of solo travel started to be nerve wracking again when I contemplated future trips.

Distance does make the heart grow fonder. As I look at my potential future journeys, I'm looking upon them less methodically, with a fresh set of eyes, a new sense of adventure, and in a way rediscovering why I want to see the world. 

It's not often that I get to reset that bewilderment and innocence of doing something new that I end up loving; the pandemic hitting right as I started to become semi-nomadic did give me a minute to evaluate and experience that again. It is kind of a cool feeling, to be honest. 

But also, still, fuck this pandemic.","The pandemic is kind of like a travel ""tolerance break"". Anyone else feel they got an interestingly positive perspective reset?","Well here's my rant for the month, not really a question. I fucking hate this pandemic, and I hate being stuck domestic, but there's a tiny silver lining for me anyway. 

About a year ago,  I took my first solo trip and never looked back on whether or not I'd like the idea. I was less than a year into really moving on from domestic travel (been to most cool cities in the US) to primarily going abroad. I did as many countries in 2019 as I had in my life prior. I had a cushy remote job, which meant workations on top of good salary and paid vacations. 

Then 2 days before I am supposed to leave for Colombia, borders shut down.

IMDB does this for movies, and Goodreads does this for books. It's very helpful in deciding what to watch or read.

solotravel,"This thread is just to get these feelings off my chest, there's no real question or point.

I love making lists of places I want to go. I love creating rough plans, writing down all the activies I want to do and the cities I want to see. I think about the food I want to eat. Maybe I'll do a workaway on a vineyard. Maybe I'll get scuba certified or do a silent meditation retreat. I love art museums. There are so many hikes around the world I want to do, I would love to go to every national park (I live in the US). Most of the individual trips would be 3 weeks to a month minimum to really immerse myself and do all these things that I want to do.

I get a rush when making these lists but then after I feel kinda sad. I'm turning 27 tomorrow, it's like time slips by so fast. Obviously with COVID I couldn't travel out of the country even if I wanted to, but still. I feel the pressure to constantly work. Will I ever have that amount of time off, what are the chances of it being every year? I wish I had started traveling when I was younger when I had summers off. The thought of the years going by and not doing these things makes me feel empty.

solotravel,"Hello! I’m new to reddit and enjoying this sub, looking for courage and advice for the next step of my heavy solo traveling life.

I’ve travelled solo since I was 21, when I went 3 weeks early to my London study abroad semester and booked a 2 wk UK tour with strangers...followed by solo trips to Ireland and Scotland, and a partly solo 5 country European tour in 9 days (lots of alone time, traveling w two near-strangers, did all the planning/routes, mainly using Rick Steve’s’ Europe Through The Back Door :). 

(Actually my FIRST time w solo travel was on a plane at 12, to Boston / Lake Winnepesaukee NH, to visit my best friend...wow just remembered that :)

Since then I’ve toured and travelled solo most my life, moved to NYC for 2 years for grad school and would take impulsive trips to Montauk or back to Chicago (near where I’m from originally), etc, joined a touring children’s theatre for 2 years and ran off on solo excursions with the van sometimes, and now, I’m a spontaneous singer-songwriter, taking nature drives and ‘songwriting adventure’ trips every month (mostly in nature since covid), and before covid, was booking frequent 4-6 day solo Midwest tours. Sometimes to based around where family lived, sometimes with strangers to play DIY basement / attic shows, developing new friendships and sleeping there, and sometimes just to get away completely solo and write songs in new places (changes in perspective help me), and in those cases, booking motel rooms or Air BnBs.

But I’m at a huge turning point and could use a pep talk lol...bought a minivan last year for touring (Sienna LE, tinted windows) and I teach piano lessons for income and currently they are all virtual and I might keep it that way permanently going forward...so I realized I could afford to travel solo a LOT more often in the future (post-covid), if I SLEPT in it! 

So far I haven’t done it, I’ve heard you can park overnight in Walmart parking lots...but I’m a little concerned about bathrooms and safety.

I’m 4’11 so comfort isn’t an issue, I’ll fit no problem...and I slept on floors on tour anyway. It’s more that I have a history of some sexual trauma so I’m less adventurous than I was around possibly unsafe things...like I wouldn’t do mixed dorms in hostels now, for instance. I’m also not sure how I’d feel parking in a secluded place...like rest stops in rural areas. BUT I dumped way too much money into cheap motels on my last cross-country trip, and I don’t want that to deter my *hopeful* (covid-wise) late 2021 adventures, sooooo...

Do you have experience sleeping in vans or RVs, parking in unconventional places? Any advice for bathrooms or safety? Any weird or bad experiences to share, with this solitary sleep-in-vehicle approach to adventure and travel?

I planned a trip to Mexico for Mid-December. I have a choice between going to Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta for 7 days.

All I'm looking to do is Wake up &amp; Surf, Work from the Hostel (all I need is wifi), Eat good food (maybe cook since I like to do that) and maybe go to a few bars/restaurants/walk around the city while wearing a mask of course!

A few more details:

1. I'm a beginner/intermediate surfer, I've done a few group lessons and can stand on my own if the waves aren't too crazy. Still learning to go left/right. I'm not sure if Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta is better for my skill level.
2. I've already booked a hostel at each location (I get a full refund if I cancel). The Puerto Escondido Hostel is right on Playa Zicatela while the Puerto Vallarta Hostel is a 2 min walk to Rosita Beach
3. I don't plan on renting a car, but wouldn't mind renting one for a day to go hiking in Oaxaca or up/down the Pacific coast from puerto Vallarta on my day off.
4. I have a wifi extender that I can plug into an outlet to (hopefully) increase the wifi connection. I don't have a problem working in common areas of the hostel, and I work essentially 9a-5p.

solotravel,"I'm planning a 9 day trip to Chiapas and the Yucatan. I'm wondering if there is too little time here to do either one well. Here's what I have planned:

Day 1 - Fly into Tuxtla Gutierrez. Stay the night in San Cristobal

Day 2 - San Cristobal

Day 3 - Yaxchilan/Bonampak

Day 4 - Palenque/Agua Azul

Day 5 - Travel to Valladolid - basically burning a day here

Day 6 - Hit a cenote, Ek Balam

Day 7 - Open/Flexible day

Day 8 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 9 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 10 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 11 - Fly back out of Cancun

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my concerns:

1. I'm trying to do too much and it won't be enjoyable
2. Lots of travel time between Chiapas and the Yucatan
3. If I rent a car to get around, it will be extremely expensive to rent in Tuxtla and drop it in Cancun

Here was my thinking:

1. I am very attracted to Chiapas for the jungle atmosphere. Maybe I'm glorifying it, but it sounds a bit more ""adventury""
2. Beach days are non-negotiable, however the location is. I picked Holbox because it sounds the like the least built-up/touristy beach option, but lack of good snorkeling is a major downside.

solotravel,"Hello guys, i am thinking in travel around the world in may-jun of the next year IF the vaccine and covid are getting better. I don't know for how long my travel will be. This is part of my doubts.

I am an asian male of 25 years born and raised in Brazil.I work as a doctor and everyone says to me that i need to do my residency first ( specialize to be a cardiologist, neuro, intensivist, whatever ...) that will take me another 3 or 5 years of my life. But i am afraid of getting to old and lose part of the magic of travelling. I know that i'm still young, but i remember when i was 18 and every travel, party or food was more magic that its today.  

I am planning to stay the majority of my time in south east asia end eastearn europe because of the cost of living. I don't know much about east europe , do you guys think it's gonna be safe for asians  to travel there after covid ?  But i want to travel to other places to like china, korea, india, israel, morroco, libanon, egypty,  new zealand, australia, USA and Canada . South america i already traveled to some places and i can always go to a quicky travel of 2 weeks because of the proximity with Brazil. 

If i make  that travel this gonna blow my economies, because our money its worthing nothing in dollars right now. . But i think that our life time has no price. Do you guys think its possible to work in places like australia , new zealand , USA or europe ? ( not as a doctor, but in farms, restaurants, hostels ... )

To the others doctor in the community, do you guys think i am crazy to leave everything behind for 1 or 3 years just to travel  ?   I don't think i will have other oportunity like this in a long time. Who know if i gonna be married with kid in 5 years or become sick or another millions of thinks that can stop me from travel for so long.  

But remember when i return i will need to take my exams, study a lot to pass in the exams and if i pass i gonna need to work 60- 90 hours for week receiving 500 dollars per month as resident doctor for more 3-5 years being older and with all my friends in other stages in life . ( Yeah we receive very little in those years).

Thank you guys for your time and sorry about my broken english.

solotravel,"Let me begin by saying I haven't traveled anywhere in over a year. I've been working a lot and getting burnt out and felt like I ""needed to getaway"".

Last week I put in for some time off and booked a flight to Cancun. I told my dad and he was a little disappointed about my decision because of the whole covid situation. 

I told him my itinerary and that he can call me anytime. He told me to enjoy my trip. 

So I'm at the train station and I see this older couple in their late 50s having trouble navigating their way with the signs. 

They asked me which was the train going to the airport. I told them I was going there too. It turns out they're on the same flight as me. 

They said they wanted to follow my lead and we talk on the train for a bit on our way there. We get there and check in. I was still getting my ticket and they said they would go to the gate first. 

I said I'd meet them there. I get my ticket and get past the gates. I decide to get something to eat. I see them at the next table but I didn't want to intrude. I just wave and we say hi. 

Afterward, I go and sit near the gate when all of a sudden it hits me - I'm all by myself. 

Now I've always traveled alone. I've been close to 20 countries all alone. I've never felt so self conscious as I do right now. 

It's like you feel lonely and desperate for some type of companionship. 

I'm sure I'll meet some awesome people at my hostel like I always do but as for right now, holy shit.

solotravel,"My first solo trip was a couple years back. I spent three weeks in Europe and travelled mostly in France and Italy. I loved Paris. Now, I'm a black woman and my friends had told me Italy was amazing, specifically the larger cities. I actually expected more racism in Paris by reputation, but I never had one bad experience there. I travelled by train from Paris to Milan and that was the start of the longest ten days of my life. It was a NIGHTMARE. Seeing as this was my first solo trip and I knew nothing, I had two huge suitcases. I get off the Metro at Duomo, knowing I could get a taxi to my nearby Air BNB. Massive mistake. It was July, the sun was beating down full force and empty taxi after empty taxi passed me by as I was flagging them down. At first, I chalked it up to the size of my bags, my youth, anything and everything. After close to an hour,  I even left my bags in an alcove so I could just jump in front of the next empty taxi I saw and make them take me. (I was standing in front of a traffic light, so they had to stop). I was ignored and batted away.  Finally, a kind trans person came out of a local business and called me a private taxi. That's the service I used the rest of my time in Milan, I never could get a cab just by hailing there. And I didn't have phone service so I couldn't use Uber or Lyft. I've never been so aware of my color in all my life. I'm a 450 in Fenty, cocoa girl and I had long faux locs for traveling convenience. I was staying in a residential area of Milan and people would literally stare at me when I walked down the street. 

A lot of it was racism but some of it was xenophobia against the African immigrants there. When I wore any kind of American paraphernalia I was treated WAYYYYYYY better. I moved onto Rome quickly. It was better but still awful. I'll just never know what percentage was racial. One night, I went to a ballet at La Scala and bumped into some white American tourists. And they told me about how badly they were treated as tourists! Some of what they said sounded very familiar. That leg of trip wasn't all bad. I did some great shopping, had the best gelato ever, saw the Vatican, enjoyed the Eternal City. But I don't know if I'll ever go back, not even for Venice or Naples. I felt so isolated and unsafe. Has anyone experienced this? Any suggestions?

UPDATE: Wow! I did not expect such a response. I really appreciate everyone’s feedback. Everyone who explained Milan’s taxi situation, you helped me see the whole experience from a different angle. I was in Paris for two weeks before I went to Milan, and I hailed cabs all the time-but I was also right down the street from the Luxembourg Gardens, so I’m sure there were an abundance to be had. I stayed in Trastevere in Rome, so I could walk a lot or take trams and buses. And when I would come home from attractions, I would automatically use the taxi stands, so I never really put any of that together before about the taxis in Milan. I’d always wanted to go to Italy so badly and I was disappointed when I did. So I’m grateful to everyone who suggested ways I could take back the experience or navigate similar situations more safely. I’m glad I posted here. The experience was always such a weight on me. I never talked about it with my family because they hadn’t wanted me traveling solo anyway and I didn’t want to give them any ammunition. I feel like I could give Italy a second chance now, but even if I never do, I feel cleansed of the original experience. Now that I’ve talked out the negative, I can just remember the positive, those beautiful sunsets, those lovely narrow streets, and the best gelato I’ve ever had.

**Nothing brings me more stress than a difficult-to-cross road.** It was a deal-breaker for me in much of Vietnam, as I stood, my entire body hairs upright, bracing to cross several times a day for three weeks, and I would find my nervous system so aggravated by just trying to cross the road that I would spend my nights inside in defeat. I was in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An, and Can Tho, and other than Hoi An, every city was terrifying to cross at many intersections. Fastforward to Phnom Penh, and I loved it, in retrospect I think because I walked the corniche so often, although I once found myself again unable to cross a sea of motorcycles again at rush hour and wound up finally biding time in a store for an hour because I could not figure out how to cross the street -- even with locals -- without having a sort of sense of nervous collapse.

I have been to Istanbul, a city of 20 million or so, and walked across a freeway once when lost, and did not feel at all anxious. So it's not only the number of people out, but also, how they drive.

Since we can reflect now, and it has come to mind as I watch videos of Cairo, where it looks like Ho Chi Minh City all over again but cars, I find myself thinking, ""I don't want to ever go there"" or ""I'd go straight to Luxor, which could not be that bad! Nothing could be THAT bad, right?"" I'd probably stay in Giza and ask if I could ride a camel to the pyramids and sphinx, from the hotel, lol!

**I'm curious about three things now:**

* 1.) does anyone else just sometimes avoid traveling to places where they feel anxious about being run-over while crossing the street, not because they have unreasonable anxiety issues but because it's just hard? Do you find it kind of wrecks your whole day and you wind up trying to take cabs (that's what I did in Vietnam, and I am not a big fan of cabs for short distances -- I love walking the city streets!)
* 2.) Where does the good people of this subreddit think the world's hardest cities to just cross the streets are, based on personal experience, and why?
* 3.) (Optional) -- for anyone who has been to either Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi (or similar) --AND--  Cairo, or any other Egyptian cities, how did they compare? That's a kind of passing curiosity now.

* I will be working while traveling and need wifi good enough for video calls

solotravel,"Public transportation in Egypt seems to be quite complicated. I have read that certain trains (or compartments) are accessible only for Egyptian nationals and that as a foreigner, you have to book a more expensive luxury compartment (for example for going from Cairo to Luxor).

The same for ferries. I looked into the one from Hurghada to Sharm, and the price is way more expensive for tourists. 

Is there any way to avoid these restrictions and get normal train (and maybe ferry) tickets in Egypt? Is just buying the ticket once you are already on the train a viable option?

I wan to see the following places: 

- Cairo
- Luxor
- Aswan
- Dahab
- Mt. Sinai
- Maybe Alexandria 
- Maybe Abu Simpel

I am flying either into Hurghada or Sharm. If it is the latter, I guess it would be a good idea to start my trip in Dahab and spend one or two weeks there. But actually, I wanted to save Dahab for last, because otherwise I fear I might get ""stuck"" there and spend my whole month there lol.

So my question is this: How can I get from Hurghada to Cairo the cheapest way possible? I have looked into it, but couldn't find any options.

&gt; I know about Go-Bus. But is it possible to catch so-called local buses in Egypt, where you just show up at the bus station and get on the next bus to anywhere? Like it works in India, for example...

I don't want to take any flights.

Also, can you recommend any other places worth seeing in Egypt? I want to avoid resort towns like Sharm. I am interested in Ancient Egyptian History, Islamic history, laid-back places like Dahab...

I am 21, male, from the EU, I have been to countries such as India and Pakistan before, so I know my way around touts, pushy vendors, shitty buses etc. 

Thanks! Looking forward to hearing any advice.","Trying to figure out transportation in Egypt (ferries, trains).

solotravel,"Hey all, bit of a wall of text incoming. 

29M from Canada here looking for a bit of advice or perspective. At the beginning of 2020 I got my 2 year tier 5 yms visa for the UK (valid until January 2022) with the plan to spend the next year or 2 traveling around the uk, working odd jobs and whatnot to support myself. Pretty standard I think. I flew over at the beginning of February and spent about a month there before COVID shut everything down and I decided to play it safe and come back home. Covid completely shut down my industry (live entertainment) so I've been here for the past few months working customer service jobs and whatnot to try and get some savings back but I feel like I'm kind of just wasting time at the moment, waiting for things to open back up (who isn't though). I'm also having a hard time letting the visa go to waste so I've been thinking of heading back in January/February and trying to make a go of it again for a few months at least or until things start to hopefully open up back home. 

So despite Covid I'm curious if anyone here has any suggestions about things to do or places to see in a Covid uk, considering I imagine most things will remain closed for the majority of this year or until a vaccine becomes more widespread. Big fan of the outdoors and just looking to explore and take in as much culture as I can given the situation. I'll likely start around London but from there who knows, I'm open to going wherever.

I understand this may come off as a bit tone-deaf/privileged given everything going on in the world at the moment but I'm just trying to make the best sense out of my situation and options.

Any feedback's appreciated, even just telling me it's still a horrible idea after all lol, as I'm still just brainstorming ideas right now before actually committing and booking anything. 

Thanks for reading and hopefully everyone's staying safe!

One the things you need to know while planning your safari to Tanzania, East Africa is ""Time to travel""

Here is the months breakdown which I thought could be helpful for someone to decide when to travel.

Tanzania Seasons: 

January to February: It is normally dry and hot. It is the calving season for the wildebeests so the  wildebeests will be at Southern part of Serengeti,  Ndutu area. Though February is the only time of the year which is guranteed to see the big herds all together move to South of Serengeti for calving. 
Easier to spot wildlife. 
Good time for birds watching since migratory birds are present.

March, April &amp; May, this is peak of wet season. Grasses becomes green and beautiful. Rains may interfere your trip,  parks are less crowded, low rates applies. Animals including the wildebeests which are famous for migration are more dispersed.

June: It is a transitional period from rain season to dry season. Grassess become green. The wildebeets start moving from Central to North Serengeti. Migration can be seen in the Western corridor of Serengeti until July.

July to October: It is dry season in Tanzania, Mostly sunny. Morning and nights get cold. From August to Sept the great heards of wildebeests and Zebras move from Northern Serengeti to Maasai Mara by crossing Mara River,  Easy to spot animals because grasses will be grazed by hebivores and also most of animals concentrates around waterholes. It is quite crowded around Seronera area in Serengeti. High season rates applies.

November to December: It is short rain season though it is still not bad to come. The grasses becomes green and beautiful.

All in all, there is no bad time to visit Tanzania, Africa beacause each month has it's own uniqueness.",USEFUL TIP WHILE PLANNING A SAFARI TO TANZANIA,"Just thought I could share with youse this information.

solotravel,"Alright, hear me out, this might be a strange one.

Ever since I've (20f) been 16 and watched Karl Watson's HK2NY, a bit of a desire to start travelling has morphed into a true, full-blown obsession. I've done a mass interrailing trip when I finished school, went around Italy for 3 weeks last year and had planned for Greece this summer but obviously, that didn't go ahead. Anyways this obsession has been completely tempted by fate due to me being a planner so last Christmas I had started planning a trip for 2022 - commencing 20th July to hit the Banana Pancake Trail, Oceania and finishing off in the US with Hawaii, San Fran and LA.

When I tell you I've planned it - I have planned it to an inch of its life (yes, I understand the appeal to not booking things for after a month of the travel you have planned but I mean to go to quite a few events before I hit Bondi Beach on Christmas Day so I have to keep to a schedule in order to do the things I want to do) so I know where I'm going, the dates I'll be there, how I'm getting there, how much it would be to get there, the hostel I'm staying at, how much the hostel would be per night and per stay with a few activities thrown in and what visa sort documents I need to enter every country.

When girls say all they wanna do is marry and have babies, this trip for around 10-11 months is all I want to do - and it's all I need to do as well. However, in this context of COVID-19, I'm trying to remain optimistic but how hopeful would a trip like this be?

Leaving July 2022 and hitting Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the US.

Would this trip be viable to happen then (we're talking about with all the events going full blast as well, Full Moon Party, Christmas and NYE on Bondi etc.) or will I have to postpone it by a year?

TL;DR: Have planned the entirety of an 11 month trip to SE Asia, Oceania, and US. Would it be responsible/viable/able to go ahead?",Being Realistic,"Alright, hear me out, this might be a strange one.

solotravel,"Back in September I asked about secret spots and great backcountry camping sites west of the Mississippi. I’ve got a post trip update of what happened and where I went! [Photos!](https://imgur.com/gallery/xCmmNRF)

Days 1-3 Holly Springs NF, Mississippi

I left home in Indiana to drive straight south to Mississippi, after stopping off at bass pro in Nashville for last minute things. Muggy, buggy, beautiful. Couldn’t light a fire for the life of me with how wet and wild the wood was. Surprised we didn’t end up with ticks after 3 days there, but we spent time hiking along cotton fields and plenty of small lakes. 

Day 4 Driving across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas

Spent the night along a truck pull off just east of the NM border

Days 5-10 Carson National Forest NM

I only planned for 3 days in Carson, but the landscape kept me there for 5. I stayed in the Valle Vidal region the entire time, hiking to a new spot every night. I was drastically unprepared for how cold the mountains could get but we survived with a few extra layers at night (I forgot to take a pic of Kingston in a sweatshirt but rest assured he was warm and goofy looking). We were surrounded by cattle and elk most of the time, great bear prevention I’m sure. Trout streams popped here and there, and with my trusty fishing license and collapsible pole we had trout for dinner once which was messy and a pain but so delicious. 

Day 11 Driving to Painted Desert, AZ

Spent the night in my car at the Painted Desert after watching the sun go down across the canyon. Dinner was couscous on the gas stove followed by a treacherous walk along the rim taking photos and warning Kingston to not jump into the void for a stick.

Day 12 Driving to the Chaco Canyon

We (I) needed a shower so we stayed in the local Motel 6. 

Day 13 Chaco Canyon and driving to the Grand Canyon
 
Chaco Canyon was mostly closed trail wise but we were able to walk to the archaeological site to see the Petroglyphs and remains of civilization. Continued on to the Grand Canyon where I didn’t have the foresight to request a back country camping permit 6 months in advance so yet another motel 6 in my favorite city so far, Flagstaff!

Night 13 Flagstaff

I am in love with this city. Nestled between two national forests with a bustling night life, it is everything I have dreamed of in terms of settling down. Stopped by 3 different dog friendly breweries, Wanderlust Brewing Co, Hops on Birch, and Mother Load Brewing Co. All three were dog friendly and had incredible brews.

Day 14-15 The Grand Canyon

We spent two days hiking the trails in the Grand Canyon, day one we hiked the south rim and Bright Angel Point. Day two we hiked the Hermit trail to both Santa Maria Spring and Dripping Springs. Beautiful hikes, very steep, and little water. Kingston was a rockstar and carried his own water in his backpack, he deserved the second bed at the motel after both nights. 

Day 16-19 San Juan NF CO (Durango)

San Juan NF was lush and green. We camped for 3 days between Madden Peak, Baldy Peak, and Silver Mountain. The campgrounds were packed tight but we were able to find a secluded point with only a few neighbors. 

Day 20-22 Bonneville Salt Flats and Antelope Island SP, UT

We spent two nights on the salt flats watching motocross and dune buggies in the Knolls recreation area. Before leaving the next day we drove across the GSL to Antelope Island to check out the “water” and saw a few Buffalo and a lot of brine shrimp/salt flies. 

Day 23-25 Teton NF Wyoming

We saw a few key spots in Teton, hiking around Jenny Lake was the precipice. 

Days 26-30 Yellowstone NP, Wyoming

I needed to check this off my bucket list, walked along the Upper Geyser Basin, saw the Mammoth Hot Springs, Fountain Paint Pot, the Grand Prismatic Spring, Old Faithful, and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. We hiked the Mud Volcano Trail, Waipiti Lake Trailhead, and Seven Mile Hole Trailhead. We were lucky to find a spot to camp within Yellowstone and reserved it for the 3 nights it took to see as much as possible.

After Yellowstone, we drove back home to Indiana through South Dakota, seeing Mount Rushmore, Minnesota and Wisconsin, stopping at a few creameries for cheese and ice cream, and drove straight through Illinois to home. It was an adventure I’d love to do again, and it’s spurred my interest in Van Life and Tiny Home living.",Spent a month traveling the western US with my dog Kingston- Itinerary,"Back in September I asked about secret spots and great backcountry camping sites west of the Mississippi.

Day 16-19 San Juan NF CO (Durango)

San Juan NF was lush and green. We camped for 3 days between Madden Peak, Baldy Peak, and Silver Mountain. The campgrounds were packed tight but we were able to find a secluded point with only a few neighbors. 

Day 20-22 Bonneville Salt Flats and Antelope Island SP, UT

We spent two nights on the salt flats watching motocross and dune buggies in the Knolls recreation area. Before leaving the next day we drove across the GSL to Antelope Island to check out the “water” and saw a few Buffalo and a lot of brine shrimp/salt flies. 

Day 23-25 Teton NF Wyoming

We saw a few key spots in Teton, hiking around Jenny Lake was the precipice. 

Days 26-30 Yellowstone NP, Wyoming

I needed to check this off my bucket list, walked along the Upper Geyser Basin, saw the Mammoth Hot Springs, Fountain Paint Pot, the Grand Prismatic Spring, Old Faithful, and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. We hiked the Mud Volcano Trail, Waipiti Lake Trailhead, and Seven Mile Hole Trailhead. We were lucky to find a spot to camp within Yellowstone and reserved it for the 3 nights it took to see as much as possible.

After Yellowstone, we drove back home to Indiana through South Dakota, seeing Mount Rushmore, Minnesota and Wisconsin, stopping at a few creameries for cheese and ice cream, and drove straight through Illinois to home. It was an adventure I’d love to do again, and it’s spurred my interest in Van Life and Tiny Home living.Spent a month traveling the western US with my dog Kingston- Itinerary",back septemb ask secret spot great backcountri camp site west mississippi got post trip updat happen went photo http imgur com galleri xcmmnrf day holli spring nf mississippi left home indiana drive straight south mississippi stop bass pro nashvil last minut thing muggi buggi beauti light fire life wet wild wood surpris end tick day spent time hike along cotton field plenti small lake day drive across arkansa oklahoma texa spent night along truck pull east nm border day carson nation forest nm plan day carson landscap kept stay vall vidal region entir time hike new spot everi night drastic unprepar cold mountain could get surviv extra layer night forgot take pic kingston sweatshirt rest assur warm goofi look surround cattl elk time great bear prevent sure trout stream pop trusti fish licens collaps pole trout dinner messi pain delici day drive paint desert az spent night car paint desert watch sun go across canyon dinner couscou ga stove follow treacher walk along rim take photo warn kingston jump void stick day drive chaco canyon need shower stay local motel day chaco canyon drive grand canyon chaco canyon mostli close trail wise abl walk archaeolog site see petroglyph remain civil continu grand canyon foresight request back countri camp permit month advanc yet anoth motel favorit citi far flagstaff night flagstaff love citi nestl two nation forest bustl night life everyth dream term settl stop differ dog friendli breweri wanderlust brew co hop birch mother load brew co three dog friendli incred brew day grand canyon spent two day hike trail grand canyon day one hike south rim bright angel point day two hike hermit trail santa maria spring drip spring beauti hike steep littl water kingston rockstar carri water backpack deserv second bed motel night day san juan nf co durango san juan nf lush green camp day madden peak baldi peak silver mountain campground pack tight abl find seclud point neighbor day bonnevil salt flat antelop island sp ut spent two night salt flat watch motocross dune buggi knoll recreat area leav next day drove across gsl antelop island check water saw buffalo lot brine shrimp salt fli day teton nf wyom saw key spot teton hike around jenni lake precipic day yellowston np wyom need check bucket list walk along upper geyser basin saw mammoth hot spring fountain paint pot grand prismat spring old faith grand canyon yellowston hike mud volcano trail waipiti lake trailhead seven mile hole trailhead lucki find spot camp within yellowston reserv night took see much possibl yellowston drove back home indiana south dakota see mount rushmor minnesota wisconsin stop creameri chees ice cream drove straight illinoi home adventur love spur interest van life tini home live spent month travel western us dog kingston itinerari,1

solotravel,"Hi,

To give some background about myself: I am a brown guy in his late 20s that has been living in the United States for more than 5 years now. Using a throwaway account because my some people irl know what my primary reddit account is and I do not want them reading this post.

Due to the culture and the very abusive environment that I was brought up in, I have never been able to have a lot of meaningful relationships, not in my native country and not since I have moved to the United States, which means that I like to travel alone and I mostly keep to myself. You maybe wondering what that has to do with my post on this sub, but I'm getting to it.

One of the very few people that I can say that truly always had my best interests at their heart and have always supported me to the best of their abilities (and financially supported me when I had to move to the US) lives back in my native country. That person is going through some pretty serious health issues right now and they need someone to support them. I couldn't just leave them to their devices in these tough times, so I have made the very hard decision to move back home to support them. I have already put in my notice at my current job (which ends in 3 weeks), and since I am here on an employment based Visa right now, I have 2 months to leave the US and would ideally like to leave around the New year's day.

I have spent most of my time in the United States working and traveling in the South and the East Coast and I feel that I have explored as many places as I could in these parts of the US, so there are no regrets there. But one significant regret I have is that I've never really had the chance to  explore much of the west coast or the South West (besides a trip to Vegas where I unfortunately spent most of my time on the strip in the Casinos), so I would really like to visit these places before the end of this year. My budget is up to $7000 (for motels and rental cars) but I am not entirely sure on what places I should visit and where I should start and end my trip and where I would stay if I were to make this trip (and how suitable the weather conditions are). I've always found the pics with nothing but the desert on both sides of the road in Nevada and Arizona highly fascinating and have always wanted to drive around on those roads. I also have a motorcycle license and would love to ride on those roads but I am not sure if it is as easy to get a motorcycle rental as it is to get a car rental (and how safe/expensive it would be).

Assuming that I have 4 days off for the Thanksgiving weekend and 3 weeks between the 11th of December - 1st of January, what places would you recommend if I want to travel the West coast and the South West alone? I have heard that the drive from Oregon - California is very beautiful and is adjacent to a beach, so I would like to cover too that if possible. I would also like to make a trip to the Grand Canyon but I don't know if this is the right season for that. I am feeling even more clueless than I would have in normal times due to the pandemic and the potential lockdown in California. So any advice you would have for me that would help me in doing one or more of the following things would be highly appreciated.

1. Ride a Motorcycle/Drive a Car around in Nevada/Arizona desert area
2. Make the beautiful drive from Oregon - California
3. Visit the Grand Canyon
4. Stops at any other national parks/places with amazing views

I apologize for any incorrect assumptions I made in this post. I have mostly relied upon what people have told me and what I found on some blogs to form my opinion about the places I mentioned above, so I could be wrong in some cases. I am not sure if I will get the chance to visit the United States again, so I would like to make the most of what little time I have left here and visit as much of the western part of this country as I can before I leave.

solotravel,"*tl;dr The title, essentially*

I wanted to discuss with fellow solo travelers who I feel must've had this thought come up. 

Last year I graduated and got a job in January that comes with 2 weeks (80 hours) PTO. As a result I immediately started to plan my next trip for March-April 2021 so I could revisit Japan (and a few other countries) during cherry blossom season. Then Covid hit and destroyed that dream, however I still want to travel the moment Covid is a thing in the past. I'm so starved for traveling that I started willingly started working extra hours during certain holidays (Like Indigenous Peoples' Day) when we would otherwise have off to acquire comp time so I could have 3-3.5 weeks of vacation when Covid ends and really make up for lost time.

Now here's where the question comes from. My job doesn't let me rollover PTO, so as a result I need to take some soon. I made an excel sheet where I put in a planned date to determine how many PTO hours I can use prior to that date to avoid not accumulating PTO but still reach max PTO by the time it's travel time. Example, if I take off 2 days in December, I will max back out around April, and 4 days means I'll max back out in June. Give or take.

As a result I've been doing some kind of pre-planning and guessing on when travel will be back to normal. As wishful thinking as it would be, I don't think March-April would be back to normal (which saddens me as I really want to see the cherry blossoms, but I'm also a hypochondriac so it wouldn't even be a fun trip for that reason), so I currently have put June as my more somewhat realistic date. Of course if that doesn't appear to be the case, I'll just adjust accordingly in regards to my PTO and such.

With that in mind, if you were to make a guess, what month (god forbid year) would you think the world would be ready for risk-free travel again? I'm just curious on what other solo travelers specifically think, because I feel like y'all may better understand the reasons why I'm so starved to travel again. Doing whatever I want, getting away from it all, making new friends, with no responsibility for anyone else but yourself. You could say I'm having withdrawals. My friends generally travel with family and other friends so they don't really understand the sense of pure freedom that I miss so much. 

Thanks in advance!","If you were a betting redditor, based off of everything we know with the incoming vaccines, how long it could take for global immunity (enough for travel to be safe again anyway), when would you guess that we'll be able to safely and freely solo travel again?","*tl;dr The title, essentially*

solotravel,"I went on a 2 Week Trip to Brazil from the US from late October and early November. I plan on describing my experience, tips, how I did concerning security, COVID, my hostel experience, and any other relevant information.

Background information on myself so you can get an idea of who I am:

\- Male, 28 years old, average build but with a NY-resting bitch face and walking speed/gait so I can at times dissuade randoms from talking to me. I have solo travelled previously. FIRST TIME to Brazil and South America

\- English: Native / Spanish: Native / Portuguese: Intermediate-High (obvious accent)

\- Brazil Solo Travel Requirement: I'd say Intermediate-Easy. If you've solo'd to Mexico, Turkey or Egypt, you're more than ready. 

Quick Notes for the TL;DR crew:

\- Would I recommend: Yes. Very much so. Highly recommend. 

\- Currency Conversion: Very good, USD is strong.

\- Places visited: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro

\- COVID: Everywhere I went people were very cautious of their surroundings, nearly everyone used a mask, social distancing was hard in some locations but for the most part noticeable measures were taken. Unfortunately, much like most of Latin America, COVID and its outbreaks is highly correlated with one's socioeconomic status.

\- Safety: I personally believe everything I read previously on reddit and other places were exaggerated. This is not to say that you shouldn’t take the smart skills and tips provided to make the informed and preventative measures. I always placed my iPhone 11 Max Pro (whatever it's called) in my front pocket, or my small should fanny pack thing, always had my money clip in front pocket too. (Regardless of travelling or not, you should always keep your wallet in your front pocket). 

I personally never saw anyone get mugged, or felt threatened; I did see some sketchy teens near the historical areas in São Paulo, but you can spot them from afar and they just give off a vibe that they're up to no good. They're not violent though, they're just skulking around, some are clearly high.  Just keep your eyes peeled for anything sus and always look far ahead to prevent anything, and look like you know where you're going and doing. They know when people aren't from there, but if you look unbothered and stern they won't even approach you. It's a bit easier to keep your distance from people due to COVID. If someone does come up and tries to pitch you a sale or something just politely extend your arm and say ""não obrigado"" (no thanks). 

In Rio I took my phone to the beach despite everyone's caution. I never took it out around the bike lanes, however you can see other Brazilians and locals jog up and down the bike lanes with their lastest phones, airpods and other gadgets. I didn't want to tempt that. I would only take my phone out on the shoreline, always after checking my surroundings. If you get a beach seat and beach umbrella from those beach vendors then you can near-worry-free use your phone and take all the selfies you want. I went to the beach with random hostel people (all Brazilians) and we had no issue whatsoever. We would take turns keeping watch on our stuff. We did ask a large group next to us if they could keep an eye on our stuff, they were very willing and even suggested we move our things into the middle of their friend circle so they could properly watch it. 

&amp;#x200B;

São Paulo: I did all the major touristy things from wikitravel, youtube videos, and random blogs.

\- Hostel: Brazilodge Hostel and Hotel in Vila Mariana. Clean hostel, nice staff. Due to COVID many young Brazilian professionals come and go through there, met many recently graduated professionals. Brazilians are very kind and intrigued to meet new people and especially foreigners. This is an upper middle class neighborhood, very clean, very safe. You can see young ladies walk and talk on their phones without worry, teens biking around with their iWatches, and people at night without a worry. 

\- Metro: Extremely efficient, clean, and very safe. The moment people pass the turnstiles people use their phones without a care in the world, on the platform and on the train itself. If you've been to NY, London or Paris than mastering this metro system will take about a whole 10 minutes. I never used the bus, mostly because I hate busses and also because of COVID. 

\- Tinder: Safe, never met anyone sus or trying to scam you. Love motels in Brazil are amazing. $50 for 12 hours gets you a pool, jacuzzi, waterfall shower and a free meal.

\- Uber: Safe, everyone I met was 4.85+ rating. They recently implemented new measures to stamp out any creeps and to make solo women feel safer and have easier means to report any scumbags. 

\- Restaurants: HIGHLY RECOMMEND: Rodizio de Sushi, omfg best thing ever. Never had a bad food experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Rio: I did take a bit more security measures as most people kept saying it was more dangerous. Honestly the Ipanema area is very safe, much safer than Copacabana in my opinion, but even then I didn't feel like people were being robbed and kidnapped at every corner. Walked around with my phone in my pocket and used it freely inside stores, restaurants and cautiously on the street. 

\- Hostel: Mango Tree Hostel. Toilets and showers could be cleaner, but it's worth the money. Great place to meet other travellers, friendly people, lots of locals, good amount of foreigners despite COVID. The very few other foreigners were also versed travellers. 

\- Beach: Ipanema beach is much better than Copacabana, fewer people, less beach vendors, less randos and sus people. All the beach vendors that do approach are polite and aren't harassing, they just quickly pitch their sale and if you politely say 'no thanks' or look but say you're no interested in the moment they'll be on their way. Don't be dick, they're people just trying to make a living. Be nice to them, they're nice to you so it's the least you can do. Some actually have good stuff. The beach seats and umbrella are about R$30 for both for unlimited amount of time. Settle on price prior to sitting. 

Public Transport: I didn't ride any, the uber's were cheap enough, I did walk around with another American aimlessly throughout the southern part of Rio, no problem whatsoever, pretty chill. 

Safety: I felt as though it was ever so slightly more dodgy than São Paulo but nothing like the fear-mongering that many other places would describe it as. I took my phone everywhere, to the beach, the streets, on the ubers, to the tourist attractions, etc. 

I dislike Copacabana, 100% preferred Ipanema beach, the vibe is different more welcoming less commercial, less tourist trap, more authentic. Also on Ipanema the vendors are more laid back and slightly cheaper. All of Rio is gay friendly, but Ipanema has a ""spot"" for LBGT+ people, they may ask you to watch their stuff, it's kind of rule of thumb to watch other people's stuff as they'll watch your stuff too if you ask, scratch my back I'll scratch yours type of thing. I also felt safer taking my phone our and taking photos on Ipanema. It's more of a gut feeling, and never ignore your gut.

Tinder: A bit more shallow people, but just as safe. Good food, people are always nice too.

Summary: I would definitely go again, thoroughly enjoyed my time, didn't have a single issue, met tons of people, great sushi.",Solo Travelled Brazil (Oct-Nov 2020),"I went on a 2 Week Trip to Brazil from the US from late October and early November.

solotravel,"Hello everyone! 

The only thing keeping me sane lately is diving into planning trips and one that I've really, really been looking forward to is Southeast Asia. I know this is a great place for solo backpackers to embark on first-time longer trips, so want to travel there first! I've done solo trips but my longest is only three months, with a friend joining me for the last month, and I'm hoping to spend 4 to 5 months in SEA. Below is my rough itinerary, in the order that I would be doing the travelling. 

Thailand: Bangkok - Sukhothai - Chang Mai (&amp; Mae Hong Loop)

Myanmar: Bagan, Inle Lake, Shwedagon Pagoda, Golden Rock

Back into Thailand: Pai &amp; Chiang Rai

Laos: Luang Prabang - Nong Khiaw - Muang Ngoi - Vang Vieng - Vientiane

Vietnam: Hanoi - Sapa - Ha Long Bay - Optional Adventure: The Ha Giang Loop – 3 Days - Phong Nha National Park - Hue - Hoi An - Dalat - Mui Ne - Ho Chi Minh City

Cambodia: Phnom Penh - Kep - Kampot - Koh Rong - Siem Reap 

Southern Thailand: Bangkok - Surat Thani -  Kho Phangan - Koh Tao - Khao Sok National Park - Krabi- Phi Phi Islands - Railay and Ton Sai - Koh Lipe

Malaysia: Langkawi - Penang - Taman Negara - Cameron highlands - Kuala Lumpur 

Singapore (only 2-3 days here)

Indonesia: Bali, Mount Bromo, Borneo, Komodo Islands, Sumatra, Lombok 

**My main questions are:** Would you add or leave out anything from this itinerary? How long do you think it'll take to do this realistically? (I'm a medium-paced traveler, I can stay in some places for 3 days and others for a week if I really like them, so it usually balances out). How much would you budget for this kind of trip?

Was there anything you did / saw / place you stayed at in SEA that you would say is a must do? 

Thanks so much in advance for the help!",Help with SEA Itinerary,"Hello everyone!

solotravel,"I'm flying to Cartagena, Colombia next Saturday. Will be spending 7(ish) weeks in Colombia. First time in South America so I'm very excited. I have a rough itinerary below...

* Salento (3 nights)

I've also looked at going to San Andres y Providencia but the horrendous events of the past week there (Hurricane Iota) make that increasingly unlikely...

I want to put this all together as a big Christmas gift. Are there any essentials that are small/lightweight?

I have the backpack, and then inside I have a compact travel blanket, extra iPhone charging cables, a water bottle, a waist strap for the bag, small carry-on-sized bottles, and some organizer bags for her suitcase.

I thought something like a travel quick-drying towel would be useful, and I also thought about water shoes for the beaches,  but I also don't want to fill up her bag with stuff she hasn't specifically asked for and/or won't use. I'm probably going to go with the towel because it's light and can really pack light.

I (20f) hope to travel through Europe for about 2 to 3 weeks by train (as I don't have a driver license) next year (if Covid allows it). I would normally travel from Amsterdam, but I'd also be willing to first travel somewhere else to start the actual roadtrip.

My problem, however, is that I am horrible at deciding where I want to go, for 2 reasons: I basically want to see everything, and I am a bit unsure as to what public transport is like in other countries (so far I have only experienced public transport within bigger cities).

I have two options for my destination:

If something happens which one of these is less likely to screw me? 

I have travelled with Etihad before but it was a simple economy class ticket. Never used flexible plan. Tried to contact their customer support on twitter and I am getting vague answers from Etihad. Qatar airways is not responding.

Edit: looking at their websites, the qatar site seems a lot more flexible where your ticket will be valid for the next two years. Etihad is using confusing language.

I'm not the type to hit as many countries as possible just to do it, but 5-7 days in a city (maybe less depending where) is usually enough for me.

Any advice on visiting any of the locations I’ll be passing/staying at? The itinerary is below. 

Anything to add, any location that I don’t have enough time dedicated to, or any other general suggestion would help. Will most likely not need many hotels/Airbnb’s because I’ll be tent camping, staying with friends, or sleeping in the back of a Jeep Grand Cherokee.

solotravel,"Hi guys! Just wanted to share with you my latest experience in the Canary Islands (Spain).

* **Trip Length**

The trip lasted 14 days broken down in this way: 4 days Tenerife, 4 days Gran Canaria, 5 days Fuerteventura and 1 day Lanzarote. I was hoping to visit the remaining 3 smaller islands but unfortunately I ran our of time. That's a good excuse to come back soon!

* **Covid-19 situation**

I  flew from the UK and there was no quarantine required upon arrival nor negative test certification (I went there in Mid-October so the situation might have changed in the meantime). However, you are required to download and fill an health control form and obtain your QR Code, to show it at the control points upon arrival in Spain. Also, a temperature check is performed at the airport.

All shops/restaurants/bars were open until late in the evening and masks are mandatory both inside and outside. Very few tourists everywhere and hotels/resorts/beaches mostly empty.

* **Logistics**

There are plenty of daily flights from London and I paid £30 only (one-way to Tenerife) with 2 luggages. The price carrying one luggage only was £12! I also flew from Gran Canaria to Fuerteventura, the flight takes approx. 30mins and I paid £20. From Tenerife to Gran Canaria I decided to catch a ferry, the problem is that I booked it only few days in advance and I ended up paying £70 for a 1,40h journey. Lesson learnt for the next time!

Once you arrive, the best way to go around is renting a car.   

You should rent a car at the airport. It’s better reserving the car on [www.rentalcars.com](http://www.rentalcars.com/) where you can find very good deals. Be aware that on top of the price you see on the website, you will need to pay the insurance, which is normally around 50/70£ for 4 days of renting. You could also choose not to pay for the insurance, but then you will have to pay upfront for a deposit of £1,100 (I chose this option in Tenerife and I got my deposit back after one week). Generally,, the roads in Tenerife and Gran Canaria are very good, especially in Tenerife where there is a main highway surrounding the Teide volcano and the traffic is not crazy at all. Fuerteventura is wilder, many roads are not paved so having an insurance is highly recommended. Renting a car is absolutely the best way to explore the island on your own and I would strongly recommend it. Also, fuel is super cheap at approx. 0,8EUR/liter so a full tank for a small car would not cost more than 50 EUR. 

* **Tenerife (Accommodation- What to see)**

I stayed in Playa de las Americas, in the South part of the island. In normal conditions, this would be the party place of the island, with loads of hotels, resorts, bars and restaurants. It’s a very clean and beautiful town, however due to covid, it was literally a ghost town (which I totally didn’t mind as I was somewhere else exploring every single day). Be aware that there are no beaches here (as in the whole island basically), but you could stay in a luxurious 5 star mega-pool resort for 60/70£ a night, like I did. To be honest this was not the best option for me as I've never used the pool or the other facilities of the resort and I could have stayed in a much cheaper place. Another lesson learnt for the next time.

 If you want to experience a more vibrant town, probably you should opt staying in Santa Cruz, the capital, especially if you land in Tenerife North Airport.

1. Teide Volcano and the surrounding National Park- what else?? Absolutely amazing. Plan to stay there a whole day. You can reach 2,500 mt with your own car, then if you want to proceed further, there is a cable car which takes you to 3,500mt. Bring a jacket/jumper with you as the temperature when I climbed was about 5/7 degrees. Tickets to the cable car can be bought online (it costs around 25 EUR). Normally there are long lines but due to the corona I was barely the only person there.

2. Santa Cruz de Tenerife- nice to wander around for few hours, especially if you fancy nice local restaurants. 

3. National Park of Anaga- in the North of the island. You can spend here easily the entire day hiking the spectacular mountains. It’s rather a green area so the landscape is totally different from the Teide National Park. Be aware that the roads are good but being on the slopes of high mountains….it might be a bit overwhelming driving through.

4. Punta de Teno- the most western part of the island, quite difficult to get there. To avoid crowds getting there, the road is closed every day from 10 to 19 and only buses go there in between. There is an amazing lighthouse at the very end of the road which you should reach at sunset to remain astonished by the view. I went there at sunset after 19 with my own car. Absolutely worth it.

5. Vineyards/wine tasting close to Pueblo de la Cruz- Actually didn’t go there but I heard it’s worth a visit- keep this as a back-up plan in case you end up having some spare time.

* **Gran Canaria (Accommodation- What to see)**

I opted for an hotel in Maspalomas, in the South of the island. Paid £50 a night with breakfast included. I could have spent lot less also here, but I wanted to be comfortable.

Gran Canaria in my opinion is the less interesting island I've visited. It's very commercial and apart from the Maspalomas dunes (which are stunning) and some hikes, the other parts of the island are not impressive at all. I spent there 4 days but I suggest cutting to 3 days max.

1. Maspalomas dunes. 

2. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The capital city. The city center is buzzling- full of cute bars/restaurants 

* **Fuerteventura (Accommodation- What to see)**

In my opinion, the best island in terms of landscapes.   

I stayed in the North, Corralejo. It’s a very cute town with lot of restaurants and bars. The North side of the island is well known for its surfing activities, so you will find a lot of surf houses and a “hippy vibe”.  Highly recommended. You could also opt to stay in the South in Costa Calma, which has amazing beaches but when I went there most of the places/resorts were closed and it lacked some vibe. Not recommended, at least nowadays.

1. Corralejo dunes- it’s a Natural park where you will find real desert dunes and a long beach to relax.

2. El Castillo beaches (especially Playa de los Lagos and Playa de la Concha where you can use your sun cream a lot…)- not far from Corralejo, go there for the best sunset of the whole island. There is a lighthouse and the scenery is very cool, especially because I brought a drone and I got very cool shots.

3. Caldern Horno- it’s a small volcano, you can climb it and get very cool photos

4. Cofete Beach- the most difficult beach to reach- you have to drive a long dirty road but…it was probably the best place I have seen in the whole trip. There is a small cemetery on the sand…if you get there at sunset it’s stunning. Be aware that you cannot swim there (the whole Western coast of Fuerte is not recommended to swim because of the strong sea and winds).

5. Sotavento beach - this is probably the best beach if you want to practice kitesurf/windsurf- it’s like 5km long, yellow fine sand and turquoise water. Amazing.

6. Playa de Esquinzo- the most famous for surfers- it’s on the West side so again not the best to swim, but the scenery is stunning especially at sunset.

7. All the windmills around the island, there are many and you can make cool shots of them.

8. Costa Calma- this is a resort place, so quite empty, but the best beaches are there- strongly recommended if your goals is just to lay under the sun

I spent only few hours in Lanzarote on a day trip from Fuerteventura catching a ferry (price 60£ with the car) so really cannot comment much. However, I managed to drive through the Timanfaya National Park and it looks like a Martian landscape, absolutely unreal.

Hello fellow travelers.
I want to on interesting trip next year. Since my plans for this year got screwed thanks to Covid. I want it to be something that i remember a long time and i don’t have regret in the aftermath. You will find more informations below.

I am from Germany.  I already did a bicycle tour from Switzerland to Berlin. Most of my other trips were basically sightseeing holidays. My only adventure trip until now was in norway for two weeks.

I already visited following countries:

-Austria
-Switzerland 
-France
-Italy (5-times)
-Spain (2-times)
-England
-Norway
-Belgium
-Netherlands

Countries which would interest me:

-Ireland
-Singapore
-South Korea
-Sri Lanka
-Australia 
-New Zealand

Length: Between 3 -6 weeks (June to august)

Budget: Enough to afford six weeks sightseeing, accommodation, flights and so on

Interests:

-Culture and food 
-Great and memorable views 
-Meeting interesting people 

Kind of trip I want:
I honestly enjoy both adventure trips and sightseeing trips. 


I am open to suggestions regarding other countries as well. My preference lies outside of Europe. As mentioned above i want it to be a trip which memories I can share with friends and family. Leaving my own comfort zone and journey through other countries before i start my own family is one of my biggest aims. I don’t want to regret my decision in a few years from now.

Thanks for all your suggestions in advance. Stay safe.",I am in search of interesting countries for a trip next year.,"

solotravel,"Hey y'all, I'm hoping to hear back from some long term travelers, who no longer travel so much. 

I'm sure most solo travelers, especially long term travelers, understand me when I talk about how easy it is to make connections with people while on the road. You go to a hostel, there's a person sitting at a table, you can basically walk up to them, strike a conversation about deep personal things, and within 30 minutes, you and this person feel like you've known each other your whole lives, and are now planning to hitchhike together to the nearest rainbow gathering sleeping under trees in the same tent because there is a sense of trust. 

Countless times this happens in different variations, it is CRAZY how many people I found myself thinking ""holy shit, we could actually be best friends wtf"" because of how personal the conversations were, how loving and accepting and trusting people are while on the road. Same with couchsurfing, and hitchhiking, and volunteering, etc etc etc. 

Now to present day. I'm starting a seasonal job in the US, it's my first official, legal job where I will have roots for the next 6 months. And I am trying to make friends here. 

But damn. It has not been easy for me. I'm so used to this instant vulnerability with people, and I'm so used to just opening up basically immediately to people because of how common place it always has been while moving around, but I don't think that non-traveling people respond very well to this sort of instant interaction. I think I might actually frighten them away? 

My feeling is that it's seen as suspicious. So, I guess what I'm asking is, how the hell do I make friends with people in a stable or regular sort of life? The travel way isn't working, so I'm not entirely sure. 

Tips for readjusting are appreciated!","Adjusting to ""Normal Life""","Hey y'all, I'm hoping to hear back from some long term travelers, who no longer travel so much. 

I'm sure most solo travelers, especially long term travelers, understand me when I talk about how easy it is to make connections with people while on the road. You go to a hostel, there's a person sitting at a table, you can basically walk up to them, strike a conversation about deep personal things, and within 30 minutes, you and this person feel like you've known each other your whole lives, and are now planning to hitchhike together to the nearest rainbow gathering sleeping under trees in the same tent because there is a sense of trust.

solotravel,"How does one plan a hybrid trip with others when the plans change completely, and go in a different direction than even alternative preferences due to schedule or budget limitations that are not shared?

I have been speaking with some friends about a trip for some time now but the plan has changed from the original idea due to a combination of Covid fears, budget and schedule. I feel bad bailing as we've been talking about this for a while, but our first choice and my alternative preference have both been decided against for a third place which I don't really care for ATM as the main draw is not in active season and there is not much culinary excitement which is my primary interest. 

The others want to travel just to go ""anywhere but here"" but I am a little more deliberate with my travel. That being said, I find myself at times wanting to be flexible and go on group trips just to go on a group trip but I am finding it difficult to commit, also because of fear of being the odd guy out and go against the flow since I prefer solo travel or travel with specific friends that I know we can align well.

There is still opportunity for me to go solo to my alternative beforehand and meet up with the group at their choice not too far away but the itinerary they are planning is fitting a lot into a short period of time. If I were to arrive after to shorten my participation, it could be difficult to join up with the others physically, and/or align energy-wise.

I am having a hard time finding the flexibility within me to join. But I feel bad bailing despite having fair reasons. 

Fellow solo travelers, how do you make hybrid trips like this work? Should I be more flexible, visit my alternate choice and meet up after and go along for the ride or do I call that it has gone too far in a different direction and just politely decline? If I were to go all that way to my alternate and not join with the others at their nearby choice, it probably would not be well perceived. So it seems to be coming down to an all-or-nothing.

solotravel,"I have been to japan twice. 

- Once with a group of 5 friends for two weeks, We went all around japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fuji, Kyoto)
- Once solo for two weeks (I just stayed in Tokyo and didnt do any day trips for two weeks)

The first time I went was interesting. I enjoyed being with my friends but most nights we all wanted to do different things, all had different budgets and regardless of what we did one person wasn't satisfied with what we did. Overall I did enjoy it though as it was much better with friends

The 2nd time I went, Was solo. I liked this a lot more as I got to see and do whatever I wanted without having to worry what my friends did, This was okay for the first week however towards the end of my trip I did feel rather lonely as I hadn't really made any friends and the majority of things I did was all solo.

Im fairly introverted. I tried using meetup/air bnb events to make things interesting but ultimately I got bored very quickly. It also probably didnt help that I chose to stay in Tokyo for the whole two weeks and I ended up just going to arcades everyday for the last 3 or 4 days of my trip. This trip was incredibly low budget, I stayed in hostels and ate cheap food as I thought it would be more wise to spend money on activities and experiences rather than food.

Anyhow. I want to go back again next year for the 3rd time. It most likely will be solo again as my close friend circle are relatively poor with money and spending and they wont be willing to spend a few thousand dollars traveling.

What were some of the things you do when solo traveling to enjoy yourself more?

Thanks!",I have only traveled international twice. Both times to Japan. I went solo to japan last year. I want to go again but have mixed feelings about my experience going alone,"I have been to japan twice.

Now that I’m working full time, I guess I’m wondering how most of you manage work and travelling?

Do most of you just travel in your annual leave/vacation time? Do you get a new job and travel when you’re between jobs? Do you take unpaid leave? Do you quit without something else lined up and just worry about it when you get back?

I’m fortunate that I still live at home currently, with very low expenses so it would be easier for me to just quit, but I’m still wondering about what all of you amazing people do. I may move out over the next year or two. And want to travel once we get through this whole pandemic thing

solotravel,"I'll start. Sorry in advanced for the long post. It's a doozy, but I'll try to keep it as concise as possible.

tl;dr: I (25M) met and spent an evening with a drunk, creepy middle aged dude from Dubai who borderline tried to be my sugar daddy and set me up with his 13 year old daughter back at home, and got upset when I got the fuck outta there.

I was in Phnom Penh by myself at a night market and I met a middle aged man from Dubai at an ice cream stall, also alone. He seemed friendly, his english was okay, so we talked for a bit and I kindly said goodbye.

I bumped into him again on the street. He insisted he buy me a beer. Sure why not, and I buy him a round to return the favour. He continues trying to buy me beer throughout the night, but I know my limit and won't get pressured to go past it. I get up to a buzz (3 or 4 beers in) and say no more, which he gets slightly upset about.

Throughout the night he would point to young local women around us and give me a creepy smile and laugh. He talked about how the prostitute he hired in Thailand stole his money, and how he has to pay for sex but it's free for me because I'm young. He says if I ever came to Dubai he'd pay for everything and he has more than $150k USD in his bank account. He insisted we go to a bar and I be a wingman for him. I say NOPE to all of this and he said something like ""come oooon, what's wrong with you? You're young!"" which he said every time I said no to anything.

Things got really weird when he started talking about his ""very beautiful"" 13 year old daughter and how he would show me more pics of her if I have time to stop by his hotel room. Now, I've never been to Dubai and am unfamiliar with the culture, but maybe this is part of it (please correct me if I'm wrong), but that's fucked up in most parts of the world. 

I'm not stupid and wasn't going to spend any more time with him past my own amusement, so throughout the evening I had stated many times that I will leave at 10pm. At this point it was 9:30 and I wanted to bounce. He insisted we get food before I leave. Fine, last thing with this guy.

Finally after we eat, I say ""alright, I gotta go now!"" He starts acting appalled and gets extremely upset (like I hadn't been saying I needed to leave at 10 all throughout the night), saying things like ""you don't want to hang out with me, fine. I buy you food, I do this and that and you still want to leave early!"" I say ""I never asked you to buy me anything, you've insisted! I've told you numerous times that I will leave at 10, and I will."" He starts guilting me, saying ""fine, go then. No don't worry about this meal, I said I'd pay for it and I will, and you still want to go. Fine."" I say ""nope I'll pay for my own meal. Nice meeting you, see you later!"" and I got the fuck outta there.

Maybe it was just a typical encounter with a lonely, drunk, creepy middle aged man from Dubai, but boy was an encounter with this type of person weird to me.

I bumped into him again on the street. He insisted he buy me a beer. Sure why not, and I buy him a round to return the favour. He continues trying to buy me beer throughout the night, but I know my limit and won't get pressured to go past it. I get up to a buzz (3 or 4 beers in) and say no more, which he gets slightly upset about.

Throughout the night he would point to young local women around us and give me a creepy smile and laugh. He talked about how the prostitute he hired in Thailand stole his money, and how he has to pay for sex but it's free for me because I'm young. He says if I ever came to Dubai he'd pay for everything and he has more than $150k USD in his bank account. He insisted we go to a bar and I be a wingman for him. I say NOPE to all of this and he said something like ""come oooon, what's wrong with you? You're young!"" which he said every time I said no to anything.

Things got really weird when he started talking about his ""very beautiful"" 13 year old daughter and how he would show me more pics of her if I have time to stop by his hotel room. Now, I've never been to Dubai and am unfamiliar with the culture, but maybe this is part of it (please correct me if I'm wrong), but that's fucked up in most parts of the world. 

I'm not stupid and wasn't going to spend any more time with him past my own amusement, so throughout the evening I had stated many times that I will leave at 10pm. At this point it was 9:30 and I wanted to bounce. He insisted we get food before I leave. Fine, last thing with this guy.

Finally after we eat, I say ""alright, I gotta go now!"" He starts acting appalled and gets extremely upset (like I hadn't been saying I needed to leave at 10 all throughout the night), saying things like ""you don't want to hang out with me, fine. I buy you food, I do this and that and you still want to leave early!"" I say ""I never asked you to buy me anything, you've insisted! I've told you numerous times that I will leave at 10, and I will."" He starts guilting me, saying ""fine, go then. No don't worry about this meal, I said I'd pay for it and I will, and you still want to go. Fine."" I say ""nope I'll pay for my own meal. Nice meeting you, see you later!"" and I got the fuck outta there.

Maybe it was just a typical encounter with a lonely, drunk, creepy middle aged man from Dubai, but boy was an encounter with this type of person weird to me.

Lots have mentioned New Zealand and Bali. Someone just mentioned Egypt on the feed which is my life goal and most said it wasn’t entirely unsafe. Anyways, here are my ideas: 

Israel- seems very spiritual and I’ve actually heard it’s really safe and peaceful. It would be amazingly intimate to visit places the Bible has mentioned. 

Greece- I’ve wanted to do this one for a long time but only two or three mentioned this. 

Taiwan- why not? 

Alaska- I wouldn’t mind living in the freezing cold for a little- as long as I’m alone and free thinking.

solotravel,"Before I decided to take this trip, I was very comfortable in life. I had a great job, a good gf, and a routine in life where I branched out of my comfort zone once in a while. However, after talking with a couple of close friends and taking LSD, I decided I didn't want a life of constant comfort/familiarity. I aggressively interviewed for a better job, broke up with my gf, and booked a solo trip to Mexico - I jumped in the deep end.

I just got back from my trip and it was possibly the best experience in my life. Where I'm from in the US, the culture is heavily based around money/status/material objects. However, when I was in Mexico, I didn't see many luxury cars and mansions, but rather met amazing individuals with strong personalities/character. There were quite a few people who pursued creative careers where they got to express themselves, people who I had just met being extremely welcoming, offering me drinks, suggestions on where to go, and access to anything I wanted. If we partied too hard one night, they offered to look after me, made sure I was having a good time and ultimately being safe. Even though the trip was only 2 weeks, by the end of it I felt closer to them than some of my best friends. 

I'm feeling very confused and sad now, because it feels like my worldview and values changed.

I felt like I truly had a passion for life and not just chasing the same things people around me are/going through motions. Now that I'm back home in the same place, with the same people, doing the same things, my mindset is reverting back to the old me.

solotravel,"Does anybody else go by (a) different name(s) while they’re traveling? 

I never really liked my full first name or the default shortened version of it. I’m from the northeast US and the first vowel is an “a” followed by a double consonant so its already overly nasal, but also since English has like 8 different ways “a” can be pronounced, accents have a HUGE effect on the way it comes out. Half the time i feel like I’M saying it wrong! 

I recently left to solo travel around the US doing workaways and seasonal jobs and have been going by a different nickname; one that’s still contained in the original, just an isolation of the middle syllable. It’s short, sweet, and easy to pronounce and remember. It’s taken a minute to adjust To it but honestly it fits well! I feel like a new person, like I’m really getting a fresh start.

No one back home knows I’m doing this and I feel like they would laugh. Maybe because it seems arbitrary, maybe because the new name is cooler and they think I’m trying too hard, maybe because it sounds like it’s short for something else entirely. I don’t care, I like it.

If I finish in my first city and decide I don’t like how it feels, I still have two or three other nicknames I can extract from my birth name (thanks dad!). When I move onto my next place I can always switch it up again and try something new! Maybe I’ll adopt a slightly different persona based on the nickname and region, who knows! The possibilities are endless! 

If you guys have ever done something like this, let me know how it turned out for you. Is it confusing to keep it all straight? Does it always feel like lying? Do you find that your personality shifts with the name? I feel like at the very least, this could be a cool social experiment.",New name while traveling,"Does anybody else go by (a) different name(s) while they’re traveling?

solotravel,"So, a little less than a year ago, I’ve traveled solo to Buenos Aires where I stayed for a month. Everything was great and became even better during my last week there, when I’ve met this cute and quite unconventional girl. She was also a foreigner, a (much more experienced) solo traveler, and she was staying there for a couple of months or so. From the moment I laid my eyes on her I knew she was special. Our first encounter confirmed that. I like to believe that she saw something in me as well. We’ve spent some relaxing time together (sightseeing, sitting in parks and just talk, taking lunch, etc.), but nothing more. 

Knowing that there was only a few days left for me there, and given the fact that I was in a near to end longtime relationship (which I also told her about), any thought of taking things further seemed pointless and inappropriate. Also, I wasn't so sure about my actual feelings for her, since I didn't knew her that well yet. Saying goodbye was tough, but I remained positive knowing that being in touch, it would give us the opportunity to know each other better and maybe meet again somehow down the road... I thought.

Long story short, came back home, ended my longtime relationship (not the easiest period for me), while messaging with her at an almost daily basis. At the beginning she was very responsive, playful and always so thoughtful, which made me think about her a lot during the days. It was obvious though that she was expecting something more from my part. I let her down. I didn’t respond as I should. Instead I was trying to be rational and keep things friendly and casual. I also needed to clear my head from my recent, difficult, brake up. There will be a better moment for this… I was thinking.

That’s when I started noticing her initial warm reactions to gradually cool down. This shook me up a little, and made me realize how much I liked her. Right before I enter the friend zone (or maybe a little bit after), I decided that, even if it’s late and despite knowing that I was risking our still fragile friendship, I had to be more direct with her. 

And then… covid-19 happened, quarantine imposed, her flight back home canceled and everything else became secondary. I naturally shifted my focus on her safety and tried to be helpful, supportive and a little advisory. When she is back home, safe and relaxed, then we can discuss about anything. The last thing she needs right now, is me writing about pink purple skies and smooth fiery lips… I thought.

Meanwhile, she had previously met and made friends with a local guy, and since she was trying to find a better (to her current miserable) place to stay and reduce costs as well, she apparently accepted his offer to go and stay with him, until her departure. To be fair though, I don't really know if that's the way it happened. Only my assumption.

But again, a couple of days before she was about to fly back home, Argentina (only country in the world) banned all inbound and outbound flights for the next 4-5 months! She now was a foreign girl in a foreign country, jobless, and with no other option than to stay there and try to weather this pandemic storm and the upcoming threatening winter. That’s when you realize that, not being able to help someone you care about so much, it’s probably the worst feeling ever! I should also mention that I offered some financial help, but her being such a proud (and stubborn) person, didn’t want to hear any of that.

Soon, the frequency of her messaging started to drop and after a relatively long period of silence, she came back with a lengthy message stating, among other, that she is ok and that “there’s been some… developments”, and her up to then roommate is now her boyfriend.

To be honest, I thought I was prepared for this eventuality (for which I blame none but myself), but it struck me much harder than I could possibly imagine. I’ve sent back a relatively ~~charged~~ emotional message along with a poem I had written before, where I made clear my feelings for her. I also stated that I understand, and although it might take some time, I will eventually write back since my caring and interest for her was real and above anything else.

It took more than a month, when I finally sent a long and relatively friendly letter, hoping to at least re-establish some basic communication. A few days later, instead of an answer I discovered that I got blocked (for the first time in my life, yeah!). Such a weird feeling. A big “why”, zero answers, and a few uncertain and contradictory assumptions, is all you left with. For the rest of your existence!

But it’s been more than two months now, and during this period the situation in Argentina went downhill in multiple ways, so it’s difficult for me to stop thinking and worrying about her. They say that time cures everything, and that the best antidote is to just meet new people. I did that, moved on, but to be honest, I still have this bad taste in mouth from how things ended up. More importantly though, I simply miss my once friend and I can only hope that she’s ok.

Anyway, this is a lesson learned and at the same time my advice to anyone (especially travelers): if you unexpectedly meet someone truly special for you, make her/him your overall priority, change schedules, forget about others, and let her/him know exactly how you feel. Don’t wait for the “proper” moment. And as we all know very well by now, tomorrow should never be taken for granted. Neither the feelings of another person.

Safe travels to all

EDIT: 

Ok I admit that my reaction was probably a mistake and I can see this more clearly now. But again, it's better to show your annoyance verbally (or written) than not say anything at all. Especially when there's the distance factor which leads to many misinterpretations, no matter how cool and smart the other person is.","Met someone special, things could be great, 2020 thought otherwise, a lesson is learned","So, a little less than a year ago, I’ve traveled solo to Buenos Aires where I stayed for a month.

solotravel,"So bit of backstory, I made [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/g85w4p/ive_come_to_a_decision_on_what_to_do_once_this/) about 6 months ago. From that point, I've found a very well paying job, as well as an incredibly affordable living situation. With the current state of affairs of the world, I am still shooting to leave in late 2021 for a 12-18 month trip around the world.

What makes me nervous is I'm getting too comfortable with my 9-5 job life, I am making quite a bit more than I thought I would be, so I'm saving 3x more for my trip then I need. I like my job, and really like my relaxing life right now. With the rate I'm saving, I could literally pay off all of my student loans within 12 months.  Given quarantine, I am spending quite a bit more time and money on my home space, and frankly on the year leading up to my initial trip, I was minimalizing my possessions so it would be easier to leave everything behind. I feel comfortable hanging out at home all day now, I love to travel but right now my home office feels relaxing.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go on this grand adventure around the world, I want to do something that most people in American society will never have the opportunity to do. I want to see how much a 12+ month trip will change me as a person, but I'm getting nervous that when the time comes to send in my resignation, I won't be able to do it. I had so much energy and excitement to leave in May 2020, but since that didn't happen and I don't know how long it's going to be until I can leave now, I don't know how to target my energy?

Anyone else feeling these vibes?

Edit: As many people are questioning the topic of finances. This is my issue, I literally set up my entire life up until the point where I want to leave to save money.  I could have afforded a really nice apartment, instead I'm living with 3 room mates, I could afford to treat myself and eat out more, instead I meal prep and shop with coupons, etc. I planned to sell my truck, my motorcycle, about $5000 worth of mechanic tools, etc.So money is the last worry in my mind, It's all about personal feelings at this point.

Financial Plan at the moment, which will be fully funded by August of 2021:

\- 6 months of living expenses in case of unemployment.

\- 12 months of everyday travel costs - this factors in not working on the road, day to day expenses. When volunteering/working along the way, I can bump this to 14-18 months.

\- 18 months of student loan payments for the entire time I'm gone.

\- a few thousand in my 401k and roth IRA up until the point where I leave, as I want to contribute to that as much as I can in my youth.

\- Around 10,000 dollars left over for savings once I get home, as I don't want to be completely broke savings wise. Rolling back into the USA being like ""I only have $4"" while boarding my plane home is not the way I want to end things.

So Don't worry, I'm being financially responsible :)

EDIT 2: Once again, Finances are not the problem, Student loans are not the problem, paying off student loans are not a problem or even a concerning thought. With this plan I will have all of my student loans payed off in 4 years or less. Please stop saying I'm dumb for not paying off student loans immediately and pushing my already delayed trip that was the only thing keeping me sane throughout my graduate program back another 12 months. If I was smart I would drop the $20,000 I have saved for this trip into the stock market instead of blowing it traveling around the world for an entire year. This isn't about the money.  


  
EDIT 3: Decided the best way to get out of this slump is to travel more, Currently looking at flights for late November for safer locations, Possibly camping somewhere or a more distanced holiday.

First and foremost, in case you didn't see it, Budget Air is pushing an AeroMexico deal that got me roundtrip from SLC&gt;LIM for **$267.** No idea about other departure hubs, but I'd imagine it's not JUST for SLC, so yeah. Don't say you weren't told. 

Anywho, I've got essentially a full week in Peru (something like 9 days to pad travel and have an actual, full week) for May of 2021. 

I have done some decent research and basically came to the idea that I should do a 60/40 or 70/30 ish time split between Cusco and Lima, with Cusco getting more time. 

Of COURSE, I want to see Machu Picchu, and I do love the outdoors in my own right (I currently live in Salt Lake) but that will probably be a 1-2 day thing for me, rather than the full 4-5 day Inca Trail. 

I am a big fan of hostel life, nightlife (although I like local dives more than clubs), and just generally interesting places to wander. Do you think my split is appropriate? I've heard Lima can be underwhelming, and was considering not bothering for more than a full day or so and just heading right over to Cusco and surrounding. Basically, making it a trip to Cusco with a layover in Lima.  

Any hostel recommendations, general thoughts on the itinerary, etc.?

**Tl;dr possible itinerary:**

Travel days excluded\*  
Day 1: Lima exploration and lots of food, night out

Day 2: Basically the same

Day 3: Leave for Cusco and explore area around my hostel

Day 4: Machu Picchu 

Day 5: Maybe MP again or more Cusco hangs

Day 6: One of the day trips around Cusco 

Day 7: Back to Lima, hang out until flight the next day.

Anywho, I've got essentially a full week in Peru (something like 9 days to pad travel and have an actual, full week) for May of 2021. 

I have done some decent research and basically came to the idea that I should do a 60/40 or 70/30 ish time split between Cusco and Lima, with Cusco getting more time. 

Of COURSE, I want to see Machu Picchu, and I do love the outdoors in my own right (I currently live in Salt Lake) but that will probably be a 1-2 day thing for me, rather than the full 4-5 day Inca Trail. 

I am a big fan of hostel life, nightlife (although I like local dives more than clubs), and just generally interesting places to wander. Do you think my split is appropriate? I've heard Lima can be underwhelming, and was considering not bothering for more than a full day or so and just heading right over to Cusco and surrounding. Basically, making it a trip to Cusco with a layover in Lima.  

Any hostel recommendations, general thoughts on the itinerary, etc.?

**Tl;dr possible itinerary:**

Travel days excluded\*  
Day 1: Lima exploration and lots of food, night out

Day 2: Basically the same

Day 3: Leave for Cusco and explore area around my hostel

Day 4: Machu Picchu 

Day 5: Maybe MP again or more Cusco hangs

Day 6: One of the day trips around Cusco 

Day 7: Back to Lima, hang out until flight the next day.

solotravel,"Hey,

When I was 25 I went travelling with my girlfriend of the time to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal for a yearlong trip. I cycled through most of SE Asia and hitchiked through Malaysia. 

6 years on and I got married and had a baby as I always planned to do. That trip has changed me forever though and I still think of something from it every day. Never has there been another year in my life which I can remember so well.

Anyway I plan to retire at 55 and I have told my wife from the start that I plan to go away to do some proper travelling again. We often take city breaks in Europe together and we visit her home country of Japan once a year or so. 

Her idea of a great holiday is the perfect hotel room and complete comfort. I want to see more chaos and dirt.

I am considering cycling through South America or maybe getting a motorbike and doing more or perhsps just travelling to all those far flung places with a backpack.

I guess my question is do you think this is a morally OK thing to do? My daughter will be in her twenties and my wife is very independent, I was also thinking she could meet me for breaks in some countries.

My other question is, what is it like travelling at that age? I am very into keeping fit and if luck is on my side hopefully I will still have my health at that age. What is it really like being the old guy at the hostel?

Thanks",Doing it again later on...,"Hey,

For me it's the La Linea crossing into Spain. Inside the border post there were a set of automated gates, and a manual counter. I instinctively went to the automated gates, thinking that like a normal border post these would be faster, only to find they are not turned on. Only then did I notice everyone was going to the manual counter. I went up and tried to hand over my passport. The official glanced at the cover, didn't even take it, and waved me through. :o

**Strictest border crossing:**

Macau by far. I got a pat-down search by officials before I boarded the ferry, this was even stricter than flying, so I had a feeling things wouldn't be easy.

And I was right, as soon as I stepped off the ferry, I got taken into a holding room. Three or four officials started questioning me: what are you doing here, where did you go before, how much cash I had on me (and can they photograph the cash?), what are the names and occupation of my parents, where will I be staying etc etc. They asked to see my travel photos and my social media apps.

After a round of questioning they took me into a second holding room, with a dozen other people awaiting processing.  Some of these people were deported while I waited so I was nervous I would be too. After a very nerve wracking hour they finally took me to the immigration counter to have my passport processed.

solotravel,"Usually this time of year I try to flee my cold and dark home here in Europe to somewhere sunny and warm. Since this years plans got canceled by the pandemic I thought I'd get a head start on next year - in the hope that we've got everything under control by then.

Mexico has been on top of my to-go list for some time now, so I started to plan the following trip for the end of October/beginning of November:

* Mexico City: 5 Days, including a day trip to Teotihuacán
* Puebla: 2 Days
* Oaxaca: 4 Days, during the festivities

 

I'm planning on traveling domestically by bus, are there any other stops along my route you would suggest? Are two days in Puebla too little time? Also, if you have recommendations on where to stay in those places I'd be glad to hear them!

As for Dia de Muertos in Oaxaca, I found a trip on G-Adventures which covers that part of my trip and would also add a few days in Puerto Escondido. Since it's very reasonably priced and I've also read some positive reviews on G-Adventures on here I'm thinking about booking that. If anyone here traveled with them in Mexico I'd be happy about some reviews.

Finally a somewhat cultural question. Where I'm from All Saints Day is a rather private holiday. You visit the graves of family and friends, which have been decorated the days before, but it would be rather strange to have tourists there. From what I've read online that's quite different for Dia de Muertos - as long as you behave and dress accordingly it's fine to visit the graveyards. Any locals or people that have been in Mexico for Dia de Muertos here that wanna chime in? I just want to make sure I don't offend anyone while I'm there.

Any locals or people that have been in Mexico for Dia de Muertos here that wanna chime in? I just want to make sure I don't offend anyone while I'm there.

solotravel,"In April of next year, I have to drive to Tucson for some work/business purposes. So assuming a baseline, I will have to drive to Arizona and back at the bare minimum for this trip. I have wanted to do a long solo road trip across the US landscapes for some time. I have enough vacation days to take approximately 10-11 days off on top of 3-4 days for my work in Tucson. So assuming that, I will have about 2 weeks to do this trip give or take a few days. My estimates say that just the driving part of this trip will take 120-150 hrs. So I will budget a week for just driving. That leaves me with the other week for my work in Tucson and any stops I make, so it will probably be a split of 3-4 days in Tucson and 3-4 days of sightseeing in various cities/parks across the US for a combined total of 7 days of non-driving. This trip from end to end will be roughly 8,000 miles. I will be driving to Arizona no matter what due to work, but I would like to see more of the western US by road as it is meant to be seen. The longest drive I have done before is Tampa-El Paso-Tampa so this will be quite a bit longer than that. I am fully aware that this trip will be very tolling on the body, but it should also be the adventure of a lifetime. This will be a solo trip by car with just me and my Toyota. Any advice on travel tips or what to see along the way is greatly appreciated. I would imagine that the mountainous areas of Lake Tahoe, Colorado and maybe Utah would have some snow during mid-April when I will be taking this trip, and I plan to take this route having accounted for snow along this route. I only plan to explore Dallas, Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Seattle, Denver, and Detroit. Any other stops will be for rest/sleep. With that in mind, here is the planned route:

Tampa-Dallas

Dallas-Tucson

Tucson-Phoenix

Phoenix-Grand Canyon

solotravel,"I'm planning a trip to UK, hopefully not so far in the future yet not during these hard days of pandemic. My main target for this trip is to see several places linked with technology and transport which are not so close to each other. For early plans I decided to visit places in West Midlands, Shropshire, Cheshire etc. My biggest issue is how to travel across these counties or through them by the means of public transport. The routes for example like Liverpool-Chester-Birmingham or some small routes like Birmingham-Bridgnorth. Travelling by rail seem to be quite a good pn shorter routes (Return on the same day ticket what a great idea!) But they start be quite expensive on longer routes at least for my home country standards. If You have any tips for travelling by rail I would really appreciate them. As for other ways like Buses I have no idea at all but heard they are cheaper and of course can get You where there's no railway. There are of course car rent companies which I consider as well (of course that's not public transport) but Haven't found any which will allow me to use their cars (I'm 21 with driving license for 3 years).

solotravel,"I saw some negative experiences from people visiting India. As an Indian now living in the US, here are my two cents that I believe will make a trip to India much much better.

1. I do not recommend visiting the big metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai) unless you are a foodie. They are unsafe and chaotic and hard to navigate. If you have an Indian friend then spend a couple days in ONE city with them and eat lots of food. If you like clubbing then hit up some clubs, because the Indian clubbing experience is unique and lots of fun. But make sure to go with a native friend who has experience. I am from Delhi. 

2. Visit the mountains in the north. Go trekking. If any of you want recommendations on hiking companies then feel free to DM me.

3. Visit the south, I highly recommend the backwaters in Kerala.

4. Visit Rajasthan, a state with incredibly unique culture with everything from architecture, food, music and clothing. But do NOT visit the big cities like Jaipur. They aren’t worth it. 

5. Hit up some national parks. I recommend Kaziranga, Gir national park etc. 

6. The northeast is beautiful and you will never find culture like you find in certain places there, like Shillong and Nagaland. 

7. Continue on to Nepal or Bhutan.

Edit: I love the big cities in India. I love the chaos, the architecture, the food, everything. However it can be overwhelming and even dangerous for a solo traveler who doesn’t have an Indian companion. I’d like to add that as a woman I never go out alone even though I grew up in Delhi.

Edit 2: I didn’t expect so many people to read this! I’d I’d known I’d have gone into more detail. Thank you to all the folks in the comments who did that!

solotravel,"Not sure about the exact timeline of this trip for obvious reasons, but in 2021 I intend to go all around Turkey and visit a lot of major historical sites on the way

I used Rome2Rio to get a rough idea of how I will make this trip around Turkey starting at Istanbul and ending at Istanbul. My planned trip will be around 25 days (my visa will only be valid for 30 days max due to my nationality), but if you count up the days in my itinerary, you'll notice they  add up to 20-23 days. Transportation doesn't seem to be the most reliable in Eastern Turkey, and based on previous experiences in the Balkans, I am expecting to miss a few connections and spend a few extra nights at someplaces. I am trying to avoid flights but will take one if absolutely necessary (I am not near Istanbul the end of the trip). This probably looks like a LOT for a month, but I have traveled at this pace before and I sleep like a baby in overnight transportation, so I don't usually get tired from fast-paced trips

# Where I need help/suggestions

1. If you see my route going past a cool spot that I haven't listed, please let me know, and I will see if I can squeeze it into the itinerary
2. If you see any of my plans based on false assumptions about transport/places that are not open, please correct me
3. If you have any experience traveling between cities in **Eastern Turkey**, suggestions/pointers on transport and accommodation will be highly appreciated
4. If anyone knows about the visa-process of taking a ferry to Northern Cyprus, would appreciate input on that. I will have a single entry Turkish visa so wouldn't wanna visit Northern Cyprus if I can't get back into Turkey. I haven't included it in the itinerary because it looks too confusing

solotravel,"I have been working for many years to make one of my childhood dreams, to solo travel the world, a possibility. As I get closer to achieving that I am starting to feel insurmountably discouraged, and hoping the community here can remind me why this is a worthwhile effort in the first place.

I started school at 20 having worked in retail through the worst of the ‘08 recession and wanting a better life. I graduated at 25 with $80k in student loan debt, and started working my ass off to have some hope of paying that off so I could travel before I get too old. Now at 30, I am actually six months away from being debt free!

However these 10 years have taken much more of an emotional and physical toll than I wanted. I paid my loans by working my ASS off at a very corporate Fortune 500 company, moving every year or two to live at our construction sites. My hair is falling out and I am becoming increasingly sad every year that I make a group of friends only to leave them behind when I move to the next project. All of my coworkers are very conservative people who have hardly left the USA, let alone as free-wheeling solo travelers, so whenever I bring up my dreams I just sound like a crazy child. Everybody around me just asks why don’t I buy a house, worry about my credit score and 401k, etc.

I just can’t ignore how positive my travel experiences have been. I find myself an infinitely more compassionate, thoughtful, and patient person when I am free on the road. My ‘fantasy’ is to solo travel indefinitely, without any sort of schedule or agenda and understand the world outside of the constructs imposed on us. I would like to redefine my life outside of the confines of the corporate world and the ‘American dream’.

Also I am really not confident I want to live or raise children in the USA.

solotravel,"I usually take an overseas holiday each year, but that's legally prohibited for Australians for the foreseeable future due to the pandemic. Instead, I made three road trips around the state of New South Wales from my home town of Canberra over August and September. I'm posting a trip report to share my experiences for the interest of other Australians.

**Trip 1: Canberra to Dubbo**

I took two weeks off in August, with plans to spend most of this time in Sydney. However, due to a COVID outbreak in Sydney at the time, the Australian Capital Territory Government strongly advised Canberrans to avoid the city and holiday in areas of NSW with no COVID cases. As a result, I booked a two day trip to the regional city of Dubbo, which is best known for being home to the vast Western Plains Zoo (the sister zoo to the famous Taronga Zoo in Sydney), and left the next day.

This was my first solo road trip anywhere, and I really enjoyed the experience. The drive to Dubbo was lengthy, but very scenic. I stopped in at Cowra, where I had my first cafe lunch since March and visited the remnants of the World War II prisoner of war camp (not very interesting) and the Japanese cemetery (fascinating).

I spent almost all of the next day at Western Plains Zoo, which was fantastic. Unfortunately due to COVID restrictions the keeper talks and animal feeding sessions had been cancelled, but there were good video versions of the keeper talks for about half of the displays. I drove home the next day via Parkes, where I visited the famous radio telescope (aka 'The Dish') and had the largest hamburger I've ever eaten for lunch.

Overall, this was a fantastic trip. I really wished that I'd allocated at least another couple of days to it to visit more of the towns in this region as there was a lot to see.

**Trip 2: Canberra to Wollongong**

With COVID advisories still in place for Sydney, I decided to spend some of the next week of my leave in the largest city in the world Canberrans were able to freely visit at the time: the coastal city of Wollongong! (population 300,000).

I drove up via the pretty coastal town of Kiama, where it's blowhole was in fine form due to heavy seas. I spent the afternoon walking around Wollongong's spectacular beach and charmless business district.

I spent the next morning at the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society's facilities at an airport to the south of Wollongong. This was much better than I was expecting, as all visitors are given a guided tour (largely for OH&amp;S reasons) and it had a huge collection of well maintained planes. Some of the aircraft visitors are usually able to enter were unavailable due to social distancing restrictions, but I was able to tour their ex-Qantas Boeing 747. After lunch I visited the Nan Tien Temple, which is one of the largest Buddhist temples in Australia - it was huge, but not terribly interesting.

This was also a fun trip. Two days was about enough though.

**Trip 3: Canberra to Sydney**

In September the advisory against visiting Sydney was eased when case numbers dropped to very low levels, so I took half a week off and headed up there. As Canberra hadn't had any COVID cases for months and there is almost no use of face masks (with the local government not requiring this in any circumstances), visiting Sydney was a novelty in that the NSW Government was strongly encouraging people to wear face marks on public transport and other places where maintaining social distancing was difficult.

I spent much of my time visiting family, but also rattled around the city. Take-up of face masks seemed to be at around 50% on public transport and lower levels in most other places. Several art galleries I visited were very strongly encouraging visitors to wear marks. I wore mine whenever I was in public transport, cramped shops and at other locations where doing so was requested or seemed sensible. The absence of foreign tourists was very noticeable, and depressing, with Circular Quay and the Opera House area being almost deserted in the middle of the day.

I also enjoyed this trip. The COVID restrictions were sensible, and were working well.

**Conclusions**

These three trips really helped me to get my confidence back regarding travelling outside of Canberra and eating in cafes and restaurants following our lockdown period. It was possible to enjoy the trips while still following COVID safe practices. Contingent on COVID case numbers remaining very low, I'm looking forward to further travel around Australia now that most of the internal border restrictions have been eased or removed.","Trip report: Three trips in New South Wales, Australia","I usually take an overseas holiday each year, but that's legally prohibited for Australians for the foreseeable future due to the pandemic.

As a result, I booked a two day trip to the regional city of Dubbo, which is best known for being home to the vast Western Plains Zoo (the sister zoo to the famous Taronga Zoo in Sydney), and left the next day.

This was my first solo road trip anywhere, and I really enjoyed the experience. The drive to Dubbo was lengthy, but very scenic. I stopped in at Cowra, where I had my first cafe lunch since March and visited the remnants of the World War II prisoner of war camp (not very interesting) and the Japanese cemetery (fascinating).

I spent almost all of the next day at Western Plains Zoo, which was fantastic. Unfortunately due to COVID restrictions the keeper talks and animal feeding sessions had been cancelled, but there were good video versions of the keeper talks for about half of the displays. I drove home the next day via Parkes, where I visited the famous radio telescope (aka 'The Dish') and had the largest hamburger I've ever eaten for lunch.

Overall, this was a fantastic trip. I really wished that I'd allocated at least another couple of days to it to visit more of the towns in this region as there was a lot to see.

**Trip 2: Canberra to Wollongong**

With COVID advisories still in place for Sydney, I decided to spend some of the next week of my leave in the largest city in the world Canberrans were able to freely visit at the time: the coastal city of Wollongong! (population 300,000).

I drove up via the pretty coastal town of Kiama, where it's blowhole was in fine form due to heavy seas. I spent the afternoon walking around Wollongong's spectacular beach and charmless business district.

I spent the next morning at the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society's facilities at an airport to the south of Wollongong. This was much better than I was expecting, as all visitors are given a guided tour (largely for OH&amp;S reasons) and it had a huge collection of well maintained planes. Some of the aircraft visitors are usually able to enter were unavailable due to social distancing restrictions, but I was able to tour their ex-Qantas Boeing 747. After lunch I visited the Nan Tien Temple, which is one of the largest Buddhist temples in Australia - it was huge, but not terribly interesting.

This was also a fun trip. Two days was about enough though.

**Trip 3: Canberra to Sydney**

In September the advisory against visiting Sydney was eased when case numbers dropped to very low levels, so I took half a week off and headed up there. As Canberra hadn't had any COVID cases for months and there is almost no use of face masks (with the local government not requiring this in any circumstances), visiting Sydney was a novelty in that the NSW Government was strongly encouraging people to wear face marks on public transport and other places where maintaining social distancing was difficult.

I spent much of my time visiting family, but also rattled around the city. Take-up of face masks seemed to be at around 50% on public transport and lower levels in most other places. Several art galleries I visited were very strongly encouraging visitors to wear marks. I wore mine whenever I was in public transport, cramped shops and at other locations where doing so was requested or seemed sensible. The absence of foreign tourists was very noticeable, and depressing, with Circular Quay and the Opera House area being almost deserted in the middle of the day.

I also enjoyed this trip. The COVID restrictions were sensible, and were working well.

**Conclusions**

These three trips really helped me to get my confidence back regarding travelling outside of Canberra and eating in cafes and restaurants following our lockdown period. It was possible to enjoy the trips while still following COVID safe practices. Contingent on COVID case numbers remaining very low, I'm looking forward to further travel around Australia now that most of the internal border restrictions have been eased or removed.Trip report: Three trips in New South Wales, Australia",usual take oversea holiday year legal prohibit australian forese futur due pandem instead made three trip around state new south wale home town canberra august septemb post trip report share experi interest australian trip canberra dubbo took two week august plan spend time sydney howev due covid outbreak sydney time australian capit territori govern strongli advis canberran avoid citi holiday area nsw covid case result book two day trip region citi dubbo best known home vast western plain zoo sister zoo famou taronga zoo sydney left next day first trip anywher realli enjoy experi drive dubbo lengthi scenic stop cowra first cafe lunch sinc march visit remnant world war ii prison war camp interest japanes cemeteri fascin spent almost next day western plain zoo fantast unfortun due covid restrict keeper talk anim feed session cancel good video version keeper talk half display drove home next day via park visit famou radio telescop aka dish largest hamburg ever eaten lunch overal fantast trip realli wish alloc least anoth coupl day visit town region lot see trip canberra wollongong covid advisori still place sydney decid spend next week leav largest citi world canberran abl freeli visit time coastal citi wollongong popul drove via pretti coastal town kiama blowhol fine form due heavi sea spent afternoon walk around wollongong spectacular beach charmless busi district spent next morn histor aircraft restor societi facil airport south wollongong much better expect visitor given guid tour larg oh reason huge collect well maintain plane aircraft visitor usual abl enter unavail due social distanc restrict abl tour ex qanta boe lunch visit nan tien templ one largest buddhist templ australia huge terribl interest also fun trip two day enough though trip canberra sydney septemb advisori visit sydney eas case number drop low level took half week head canberra covid case month almost use face mask local govern requir circumst visit sydney novelti nsw govern strongli encourag peopl wear face mark public transport place maintain social distanc difficult spent much time visit famili also rattl around citi take face mask seem around public transport lower level place sever art galleri visit strongli encourag visitor wear mark wore mine whenev public transport cramp shop locat request seem sensibl absenc foreign tourist notic depress circular quay opera hous area almost desert middl day also enjoy trip covid restrict sensibl work well conclus three trip realli help get confid back regard travel outsid canberra eat cafe restaur follow lockdown period possibl enjoy trip still follow covid safe practic conting covid case number remain low look forward travel around australia intern border restrict eas remov trip report three trip new south wale australia,1

Hey guys I just wanted to chime in and talk about the trip I went on this past weekend! 

With Covid going on it’s been a pretty dull year so far but I wanted to try and do something safely. I live in NJ and decided to drive to Virginia to go camping in the Shenandoah valley. While down there I visited the Luray caverns which I must say were absolutely beautiful and I fell in love with Shenandoah National park. 

This was the first solo trip I ever went on! On top of that this is the first time I’ve ever gone camping too! I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t anxious and nervous approaching it. I was a little scared that I would end up not liking it and just sucking it up telling people it was great. 

My experience truly was incredible! I finally understand all the love and hype for solo travel that I’ve been looking into for months. I felt so at peace the entire time. It was such a good feeling knowing everything I was doing, was literally what I wanted to do. There were no arguments about what to do or any of the other typical situations with group trips. 

I’m so excited for things to improve in the world so I can travel a little more openly and start this solo travel journey! 

I love all of your posts in this sub, they truly make me excited for what is out there. 

Also before the negativity comes in with traveling during Covid. I actually took a Rapid test today which came back negative and I am quarantining until my PCR test results come back!

solotravel,"I appreciate any thoughts. The post is long, but I wanted to give context.

Background: Late 20s Male. Mech eng, former US service member(lived and traveled overseas). 1800/month passive income. No expenses. No debt. At or above US averages for my age in cash and in 401k. 

The Situation: In the next few weeks I'll be negotiating a raise that I believe I deserve and discussing my future at the company long term. I don't want to get bogged down too much on these details, but the important part is I live in NJ and if significant raises or promotions don't seem likely in the next 5 years then I'm bailing on NJ due to the cost of living. 

The Question Preface: If this scenario plays out(seems likely) and covid has died down a bit by Spring/Summer 2021 I would like to take my time in finding a new job. My criteria for a new location leaves the vast majority of the US open. My thinking is whether I am in NJ or any other place with internet I can work on finding a job and applying, plus after my lease is up I'll have nowhere to live(I'm getting rid of pretty much everything I own"")

The Actual Question: Where can I live(outside US) for 1800 usd/month? I'd dip into savings if I wanted to do day trips etc. 

Requirements: Costal. Reliable internet. Not completely off grid, but not in the heart of a major city"". Need a private room. Hostel is fine, but private room required. Car not required. 

Research thus far: I've found a lot of the ""10 cheapest places to retire"" lists have been a good start. 

Cascais, Portugal- Has anyone been here? It seems nearly too good to be true. I like the fact that I'm in easy train shot to Lisbon and could walk from my room to the beach, supermarket, downtown. 

Cartagena, Colombia- I'm struggling to research if there is a suburb with easy access to the city. I don't really want to be ""in-in"" the city or any major city. Any experience anyone?

Mancora, Peru- The articles surrounding here either talk about it being a big party town or sleepy town, I'm assuming it is seasonal, any thoughts?

Typical day- I wake up and grab a local coffee/espresso with a light walk. Go back to my room, research jobs, areas, and tailor resumes for 2-4 hours. Eat lunch then go for a rigorous workout. Explore local area, read at the beach maybe get involved in some sort of group activity or learning(language, yoga, painting).

Typical Friday/Saturday- Enjoy the local bar playing music, maybe there are vacationers or expats or locals I can chat with over a beer. I'm fine with partying, but I'm not looking for a Cancun/Ibiza spring break deal.

Sunday- Take public transport to check out whatever.

The purpose of this trip is to unwind, plan, enjoy, and help me decide what I want.

Dear Solo Travelers, 

OK so I am starting to get a little overwhelmed while planning this trip. That's why I've come to this great community for help!

So I may be planning this a little early but I'm trying to get my ducks in a row for this upcoming summer. I have roughly $5000 maybe $7000 to spend on this trip and I'm trying to make it last for as close to 3 months as possible. 

This will be my first trip outside the U.S. so I hope to see as many places without being extremely rushed. That's why I'm shooting for a 3 month time frame. I also hope to hit a few of the paintball places on the map above. I think it would be really cool to paintball in a few different countries along the way.

I hope to pack as light as possible and hit hostels/couch surf almost the whole way. Along with the paintball stops I hope to stop in Istanbul and Slovakia to meet up with some friends. 

So I guess my question is how to I proceed to make a coherent plan where I'm able to paintball, meet my buddies, hit a few major ""attractions"", and explore local villages while staying on budget and staying as long as possible?

Domestic around the US to big cities and rural areas. I love everything from rural PA to downtown Chicago.

**Length:**

8-10 days

**Budget:**

I've been saving for a while, all in I wouldn't mind spending $3k (including flights/hotels)

**Interests:**

Sightseeing, nature, museums, tourist attractions, eating local Mexican food, walking/boat tours, partying. Someone recommended teotihuacan, and that looks right up my alley. My loose plan is to sight see/try new places to eat during the day and go out at night.

**Accommodation:**

I was originally considering staying in a hostel (Hostal Regina Centro Historico), but that's not the smartest idea so I'll most likely do AirBnB or hotel. Will tinder be good for meeting people? **Are there any must see places if you're in Mexico City?**

First of all, I know that travel is discouraged because of Covid-19.

That being said, I have had a business opportunity come up that I basically cannot pass up on, but it would require me to travel to Minsk for a week.

Given the political climate there, I was wondering if a tourist who will mostly stay at a hotel and go to predetermined places for meetings would run into any obstacles.

I don't drive, nor do any of my friends in London so I'm relying on public transport.

solotravel,"So I see lots of posts here with folks mentioning things like visiting a new country for, say, a month, and making local friends with whom they still stay in contact. Or getting invited into a local's home for tea and dinner. Or spending the day with a local, or exploring with other travelers, etc.

I'm wondering how people find themselves in these situations? One of my favorite things when traveling is meeting locals and just hearing about their perspective; I feel like I come away from it with a deeper understanding of the place I just visited.

I also enjoy meeting fellow travelers for similar reasons, just to learn about their experiences and, I suppose, expose myself to a more diverse array of people than I would meet here in the US.

The problem with me is I'm fairly introverted. I'm not shy per se, and will try to strike up others in a hostel, for example, but if I sense a cold reception on their part then I get discouraged and withdraw, not wanting to bother them.

On top of this, I usually plan my day around visiting cool landmarks, sites, restaurants, etc. but this activity isn't super conductive to meeting others, because it feels weird to be at a temple, for example, and cold approach a stranger to just start conversing with no context. 

So far, this has been my experience, where the people I reach out to seem to not care to have anything to do with me, whether that be a group of travelers fine on being amongst themselves, or locals who don't want to interact with a foreigner.

solotravel,"Hey everyone,

Since not a lot of us are current travelling at the moment, thought it might be nice to reminisce about a recent travel experience while also helping to share some recommendations for people planning to travel there in the future.

**What was a memorable trip that you recently took? Are there any specific places or activities that stood out that you'd highlight to other travellers?**

I'll start! One of my favourite trips was to **Kauai, Hawaii**. I love being in the outdoors and so the activities here were perfectly suited for that. I haven't been to the other islands, but had such a great experience here I might just want to come back.

* **Transportation**: The entire island is extremely small; however, in order to make the most of it, it is highly recommended that you rent a car. This will allow you to drive to parts of the island in 1-2h. Although I would have loved to get a Jeep - you really don't need one (unless you're going to some off-road terrain) and can save money by renting a regular car.
* **Food**: Really enjoyed lots of food trucks and snacks! Recommend:
   * **The Fish Express**: This was the best poke I had (tried several locations, and only found this on the last day).
   * **Trucking Delicious**: Delicious coconut shrimp
   * **Wailua Shave Ice**: Shave ice was great here (and its different than the regular shaved ice you think of at carnivals /snowcones).
   * **Java Kai**: Think smoothie bowls and avo toast.
* **Activities:**
   * **Hiking:** Tons of great trails with all different types of scenery and lengths. Check out AllTrails app.
   * **Surfing:** I'm an absolute beginner and went to the south area (since I was advised against going to the north during the Winter season). There was a nice area next to the Sheraton which was beginner friendly. Didn't want to take a lesson since I'd taken one before and just wanted to mess around with a board. **Kauai Surf School** (I think) rented boards for $10/h. :) Am sure there were other areas where you could also rent a board but I liked that this was on the water and you could easily see where other people were trying to catch waves.",What was your most memorable trip in pre-COVID 2019-2020 and what specifically would you recommend to your friends or solo travellers?,"Hey everyone,

solotravel,"I graduated college last year in May. I’ve been working full time since and have saved up about $45k. By the time COVID is over and travel is fully opened and welcomed again, I estimate I can grow that to around $60-75k depending on how long it takes. 
 
I’m 25 M. I have a decent job making around $50k/yr. Can double my salary if I stay with the company for another 5 years. But I hate it. I don’t hate the company, I don’t hate the people, I don’t hate the job. I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life sitting in an office doing things that I don’t want to be doing.

All I have ever been told in life is go to school, get a good job, buy a house, get married, and have kids.

I have a college education, I have a good job, I rent my own house, I have a beautiful girlfriend. And yet, I’m certainly not satisfied. The only thing I’m missing is the kids, and I don’t want any, but I’m pretty confident a child won’t make me happy either. 

I want to explore the world beyond the suburbs that my great grandparents, grandparents, parents and now myself have lived and worked in our entire lives. I want to experience different cultures and see new perspectives. I want to explore something bigger than myself. I want to overcome my fears and anxiety. I want to develop and grow into a stronger individual. I want to learn to love myself fully and be comfortable alone. Solo travel seems to satisfy all of these. Right? 

It’s so easy to get comfortable. Then before you know it, 15 years go by, you are 40 years old with kids, a wife, a mortgage. You are no longer living for yourself. You live to support others. There’s nothing wrong with this lifestyle if it makes you happy. 

I am at a very crucial point in my life where I need to decide which road I am going to take. 

I’m still young, I have no kids, the only debt I have is 20k in student loans ($250/monthly), I rent, my car is paid for, I have a good amount of savings. One or many of these things may change in the next 5 years. 

So I ask from anyone who has taken the jump, can you please share your wisdom and experience? How much money did you have saved up when you left? What is/was your long-term game plan after cash reserves dry up? How long are you going to live the lifestyle and what is the plan after? Where did you go? Can you give me any advice specific to my situation? 

Would you do it all over again?

EDIT: This post turned into great discussion and I truly appreciate everyone’s kind words and motivation. I really needed it. I want to thank everyone for their input. It has been invaluable to me. 

After reading a majority of the comments, I want to address a few of the most asked questions: 

1. Why haven’t you paid off your student loan debt? 

I’ve heavily considered it. I decided not to because the interest rates are low (3.5%). All federal loans. Meaning, I could invest the same amount of money that I would use to pay it off, earn 7% interest in the market, and profit the 3.5% spread. BUT if I’m going to be traveling long-term, I really don’t want to deal with it or have to worry about it at all. So I will more than likely pay it off before I leave. 

2. Is my girlfriend coming with me?

No. My girlfriend is awesome, don’t get me wrong. But this is something I need to do alone. Our relationship is still new. We aren’t on the cusp of getting married or anything. And she knows this is something I am considering. I’ve been transparent from the start. 

3. How did I save so much in that amount of time? 

Zero expenses. Well not zero, but pretty damn close. I was living with my dad for 17 of the past 18 months after I graduated. I just started renting at the beginning of this month. I paid nothing in rent, nothing in utilities, student loans have been deferred due to COVID, I own my car. The only expenses I had were my phone bill, car insurance, and whatever food/activities I wanted to spend money on. This allowed me to save almost all of my income. I also worked for my dad occasionally to earn some extra cash whenever I could. I realize not everyone has this opportunity. I am forever grateful that I did.

4. Can you work remotely? Is your industry easy to get back into? 

Yes and yes. My job can be done 100% remotely and there are plenty of companies in this industry that I could seek employment from with my experience. Unfortunately, my boss is old fashioned and conservative in his ways and wants everyone in the office 5 days a week. 

That being said, and with all of the helpful advice and wise words people have given me, I have laid out a new game plan:

Continue working and saving for at least the next year. This will allow me to build up more experience, put away some more cash into my reserve fund, and pay off my loans. I’ll be able to stick it out for another year. Hopefully by then COVID will have passed and people will be welcoming of foreign travelers again. 

I will then propose to my boss that I continue working for the company on a part time basis 100% remotely so I can travel and have some of my time back. If he declines, I quit and travel on my reserve cash for awhile keeping expenses low and living frugally. 

Once I need to start making an income again, I will look for a 100% remote position in my current industry. It shouldn’t be hard to find. If that doesn’t work, I will use some of the other great tips in this thread for making an income while traveling like online tutoring or teaching english.

I’m sorry I was not able to respond to many of you. I have been busy with work (ironic lol). Hopefully this update will be sufficient. Thank you again to everyone who commented and for your kind words! You truly have made this decision so much easier. The leap does not seem nearly as intimidating after hearing all of the great stories about how it worked out for people and how they did not regret it for a second. 

Much love everyone! May we all satisfy our deepest desires and live a life of fulfillment and meaning!","After COVID, I want to quit my job and solo travel long-term. Am I crazy?","I graduated college last year in May. I’ve been working full time since and have saved up about $45k. By the time COVID is over and travel is fully opened and welcomed again, I estimate I can grow that to around $60-75k depending on how long it takes. 
 
I’m 25 M. I have a decent job making around $50k/yr. Can double my salary if I stay with the company for another 5 years. But I hate it. I don’t hate the company, I don’t hate the people, I don’t hate the job. I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life sitting in an office doing things that I don’t want to be doing.

All I have ever been told in life is go to school, get a good job, buy a house, get married, and have kids.

I have a college education, I have a good job, I rent my own house, I have a beautiful girlfriend. And yet, I’m certainly not satisfied. The only thing I’m missing is the kids, and I don’t want any, but I’m pretty confident a child won’t make me happy either. 

I want to explore the world beyond the suburbs that my great grandparents, grandparents, parents and now myself have lived and worked in our entire lives. I want to experience different cultures and see new perspectives. I want to explore something bigger than myself. I want to overcome my fears and anxiety. I want to develop and grow into a stronger individual. I want to learn to love myself fully and be comfortable alone. Solo travel seems to satisfy all of these. Right? 

It’s so easy to get comfortable. Then before you know it, 15 years go by, you are 40 years old with kids, a wife, a mortgage. You are no longer living for yourself. You live to support others. There’s nothing wrong with this lifestyle if it makes you happy. 

I am at a very crucial point in my life where I need to decide which road I am going to take. 

I’m still young, I have no kids, the only debt I have is 20k in student loans ($250/monthly), I rent, my car is paid for, I have a good amount of savings. One or many of these things may change in the next 5 years. 

So I ask from anyone who has taken the jump, can you please share your wisdom and experience? How much money did you have saved up when you left? What is/was your long-term game plan after cash reserves dry up? How long are you going to live the lifestyle and what is the plan after? Where did you go? Can you give me any advice specific to my situation? 

Would you do it all over again?

EDIT: This post turned into great discussion and I truly appreciate everyone’s kind words and motivation. I really needed it. I want to thank everyone for their input. It has been invaluable to me. 

After reading a majority of the comments, I want to address a few of the most asked questions: 

1. Why haven’t you paid off your student loan debt? 

I’ve heavily considered it. I decided not to because the interest rates are low (3.5%). All federal loans. Meaning, I could invest the same amount of money that I would use to pay it off, earn 7% interest in the market, and profit the 3.5% spread. BUT if I’m going to be traveling long-term, I really don’t want to deal with it or have to worry about it at all. So I will more than likely pay it off before I leave. 

2. Is my girlfriend coming with me?

No. My girlfriend is awesome, don’t get me wrong. But this is something I need to do alone. Our relationship is still new. We aren’t on the cusp of getting married or anything. And she knows this is something I am considering. I’ve been transparent from the start.

It would be nice to fit in as many cool destinations as possible during each day (both for experience and for keeping sitting for long amounts of time in the car to a minimum). We'd also like to go as far and visit as many states as possible with these requirements too haha. If anyone has any suggestions, questions, or a ""roadmap""/plan, please let me know!!!Highschool spring break road trip suggestion",ok let give run coupl buddi highschool senior want trip school spring break march th april th want stay budget though ga food much problem locat northeast ohio would like ventur toward west south would also like implement camp trip ideal day would like drive differ destin like park someth get near night even earlier stop camp place sleep night would nice fit mani cool destin possibl day experi keep sit long amount time car minimum also like go far visit mani state possibl requir haha anyon suggest question roadmap plan pleas let know highschool spring break trip suggest,0

roadtrip,"Hi guys, I'm in the early planning stages of what will be a once in a lifetime road trip with my s/o (who will, by the end of the trip, be my wife).

We've got up to 6 weeks we can use for this trip and will be flying in from the UK to LA. I'm looking for some advice first and foremost on if this itinerary is too ambitious, just about right, or if we should be adding more destinations to fill the time. I'm also happy to take any suggestions of things to see, spots to add or spots to remove.

We'd like to book as little as possible in advance so we can have some flexibility around how long we stay in each spot and where/for how long we make our stops between destinations. We'll have a hire car for our whole trip (with possibly the exception of SF as i've heard there's not much point having a car there).

I understand that the ""ideal"" trip will vary from person to person and you could spend anywhere from 1 night to a week in any of the national parks, but any insight you guys can give would be much appreciated.

Our extremely tentative itinerary is as follows, and these are only the 'major' spots, stuff we absolutely have to see. We're more than happy to make stops elsewhere between all of these places:

LA - 3/4 nights

San Diego - 1/2 nights

Phoenix - 1/2 nights

Grand Canyon (happy to add in monument valley, Arches, Canyon lands here before we continue)

Bryce

Zion

Las Vegas - 3/4 nights (getting married here)

Sequoia national park

Yosemite national park

SF - 3/4 nights

Then back towards LA down the coastal highway with stop offs on the way.

We both are in our early 30s and are huge lovers of nature, food (anything from cheap street food to fine dining) and enjoy the remote country as much as the inner city. We're not big drinkers so not interested in the party scene, although we're happy to enjoy a relaxed drink to watch the world go by or chat it up with some strangers. We're happy to hit touristy spots but would also love to hit some stop offs in ""real america"". Neither of us have been to the west coast before (i spent some time in New York, Chicago and Maine around 20 years ago and my s/o hasn't been to the US since she was a small child).

Accommodation will be a mixture of hostels, airbnb, motels and hotels, we're also looking in to doing homestays.

As i mention in the title, this trip will ideally be starting in mid march, so the reason we've planned the loop counter clockwise is because we figure the temperatures in AZ/UT will be a bit lower at the start of our trip - we are English after all. If you guys think the temperature won't be a concern at this time of year, i'm happy to change the direction of our loop.

I realise this is quite vague but as i said, i'm in the early stages of planning and i don't want to get too set on a particular plan and then find out it'll be undoable or a major pain in the ass.

Any advice you can give would be hugely appreciated!","CA, AZ, UT, NV 6 week Road trip March/April 2022","Hi guys, I'm in the early planning stages of what will be a once in a lifetime road trip with my s/o (who will, by the end of the trip, be my wife).

roadtrip,"Hey y'all!

This is going to be me and my wife's first multi day road trip and we plan to head down to the panhandle of Florida, all the way down to Key West, and back up the other side. We're renting a van and using an air mattress to essentially ""car camp"". I've got a lot of things planned/figured out including where to sleep and where to visit along the way. Since it's Florida, a lot of the attractions are outside and I'm not worried about eating at restaurants because finding somewhere we can eat on a patio would be the choice because of Covid anyway or we'll just do take out. So all in all, planned this way or not, about 80% of this trip is dog friendly.

However we weren't planning on bringing our dog because there were a handful of places we wanted to see that would not be dog friendly (a couple of museums, Kennedy Space Center, Cumberland Island ferry) and a couple of activities might not be either (Everglades tour, etc.). But it looks like our built in dog sitter (MIL) may be flaking on us.

This isn't the end of the world, our dog is a 12lb Mini Schnauzer that loves car rides and going everywhere with us and can easily be put in a bag/sling to be carried comfortably when walking around. But it does put the breaks on some of the aforementioned stops. I'm trying to be positive about it but there was definitely a couple of those things I was really looking forward to!

So, there's my question. Have any of you road tripped with dogs and still enjoyed a stop or two that wasn't dog friendly and how did you do it? Is there kennels that you can find for short term? Leaving her in the van isn't an option. Aside from the temperature she has separation anxiety and I just don't no if that would work out.

**TLDR**; I've planned a road trip with my wife that has a few dog unfriendly stops but we may be bringing our dog. Do we just cut our losses and skip those places or is there some way that we can have our cake (dog) and eat it to (see the Dali museum)?",Planning a road trip around the Florida coast and the dog might be coming along.

roadtrip,"Hi all!! I (F/18) am really new to roadtripping, but I’ve been feeling really trapped due to college pressures, covid, etc., and I think a little getaway is just what I need.

I’d love some recommendations from more experienced travelers about short trips I can take around Northern California. My home base is San Francisco, and I have no issues driving quite a long ways.

I’m a college student so money’s a bit tight... so sleeping in my car, camping, or maybe renting an Airbnb for one or two nights max would be best!

After that?  I'm not entirely sure!  I'll be asking them where they want to go and such. But I dont want to just ""wing it"" you know?

I'm conflicted between august 2020 and march 2021(based on suggestions from the last post)

I'm going to start near Arizona (because I can get a car there)

I want august to win because it's
a. Sooner. 
b. It's when my rentel lease ends and I won't have to find a temporary housing solution and move all my things. 

But I'm not convinced because I'm not sure how's the covid situation is going to be like, and I'm not sure if the following months are good for some of the activities I want. 

Places: 

* Yosemite park(most important)
* Grand canyon.
* Sequoia national park.
* Angels landing.
* Colorado
* Montana

Activities:

* Hunting
* Meeting people at bars 
* Maybe go to a university party
* Driving a lot

March would be better because all the following months are nice to travel and covid-19 shouldn't be as big of a deal(hopefully)

First of all, sorry for my poor grammer.

My gf and I really want to book a roadtrip across the Westcoast with our 2 kids (3 and 5) next summer. It’s on our bucketlist and cryptocurrency has been good to me, so we thought let’s go for it next year.

We want to go at least 3 weeks and we want to travel with a camper. 

I’m curious if someone has some tips, like places we really need to visit, especially with 2 little boys. I’ve read good things about yellow stone, but I’m in doubt if it’s worth the travel.

We are dutch so not really used to traveling long distances by car (besides 2 vacations to France😉).

My gf and I really want to book a roadtrip across the Westcoast with our 2 kids (3 and 5) next summer. It’s on our bucketlist and cryptocurrency has been good to me, so we thought let’s go for it next year.

We want to go at least 3 weeks and we want to travel with a camper. 

I’m curious if someone has some tips, like places we really need to visit, especially with 2 little boys. I’ve read good things about yellow stone, but I’m in doubt if it’s worth the travel.

We are dutch so not really used to traveling long distances by car (besides 2 vacations to France😉).

Well I hope you guys have some good tips!

For this trip, we plan to take a Honda Civic sedan and camping gear, including our beloved 3-fold foam mattress.

I'm starting in Southern Maine and thinking of going south along the Appalachian Mountains into Virginia, possibly through Tennessee, to Arkansas, Colorado, down through Arizona and finish going up north through California to San Fran! I plan on only spending about a month and a half on this route. 
I am meeting a friend (who plans on biking across country) in California and then traveling back to Maine together through the pacific north west, a trip we plan to last about a few weeks

I am definitely getting a national park pass for easier access into parks, and a planet fitness membership for showers and such. Other then that I have barely started planning so any and all suggestions for best routes, or must see spots along the way are very appreciated! &lt;3

roadtrip,"Hullo! I’m planning a road trip across the US after spending years tied down to a job that caused me to be somewhat locked down. I love the mountains, nature, sights, fishing, and just seeing new things and people. 

I live in eastern North Carolina, so that’ll be my starting point. Of course this is still a super early idea/plan so I haven’t put a ton of thought into it, but I’d like the end point to be Yosemite National Park and then going up to Yellowstone, almost making a giant circle. I’ve looked up all the basic directions and understand this is a ton of driving. This is a multiple week kind of thing. I have a fairly decent midsize suv for the trip, and was hoping to camp out in it for the better part of the nights. 

My biggest questions are these: 

What are some preparations or items that’ll be helpful/vital for this trip?

Are there any must see areas that’ll be around these destinations? The furthest I’ve been outside of my state is mostly within an hour or so of the NC border so I’ve not been many places, but I’ve done tons of long distance driving in the NC mountains.

roadtrip,"Hey reddit,

I frequent other threads in reddit and came across this one - of which I was excited because my wife and I are starting to plan a road trip in July. We have done lots of camping and visited a few National Parks, but we have never road tripped so we were looking for any and ALL advice.

We are definitely squeezing the trip in - we are only able to take two weeks off from work, which gives us 15 days total (18 total, but due to covid restrictions we have to take a mini quarantine upon return home). I know this is not a whole of time, but we'd like to take to the road anyway. We'll be leaving from July 8th night and hoping to return on Friday night the 23rd - which gives us a two day buffer. There is a small chance I could extend this by maybe a day or two, but I'm not counting on that.

We live in Maine, therefore will be leaving from Maine, and plan to drive straight west. Our initial thought is to ""grind"" the first section of driving to get to West coast as quickly as possible, giving us time to drive and explore there.

We were thinking of hitting the Badlands, YellowStone, Crate Lake, Redwood, Yosemite, Sequoia, Zion, Arches, Grand Canyon and then drive straight back home. I'm aware I could spend 2 months at each park and still be awed, but unfortunately, this is not how we can do it at the time. We also and add or subtract any of these stops.

We plan on taking my Tacoma and camping the whole time. We don't want to stay at hotels or anything. Either camp outside in the park, or camp in the bed of the truck. Either is fine.

Is there anyone out there that has visited any of these parks and has camping or car camping advice? Reservations? I know reservations can be really challenging, hence why we are open to car camping. Any veterans out there with advice on what to bring, what to expect, things to look out for? Any resources I should extend my research too? Any good apps for road tripping info? Is there a better thread in Reddit I could be utilizing? Anything would be helpful!

roadtrip,"Hi all.

Bit of what may be perceived as an odd question, but : what are people’s experiences with ride sharing on road trips?

Are there any Uber-esque apps etc that let you go ‘I’m going to travel from point A to point B on date X, anyone want a ride?’

I ask because my wife and I (from NZ) are starting to plan a 6 week road trip from Denver to Seattle, and we’re quite gregarious types who love meeting new people so I’m inclined to offer spots to people who want to come along for sections of the broader trip. Not even for money - just to meet new people, which is half the fun of travelling.  

It’s something I’d quite like to do but I can’t find any apps or sites that facilitate it. I guess there’s always the nagging doubt that you’re going to pick up (or ride with) some sort of crazed axe murderer or something, but in all my years driving I’ve never had a bad experience picking up any roadside backpackers etc so I’m quite comfortable with the concept.

Where should I go next on my way home to the SF Bay Area, with two or three days to fill?
Are there any hidden gems with photogenic rock formations and some hiking? And maybe not too cold?

roadtrip,"   My wife and I have been planning to take a vacation sometime in May or June. We were thinking about flying somewhere, but we will have our 4 year old, and though we will be fully vaccinated, he won't. So we are considering driving somewhere. We live in Glendale, AZ. We plan to take 8-9 days off. The current thought is to drive somewhere over a 1-2 day period (probably 6-8 hours a day), stay for 3-5 days, then 1-2 days driving back. We want to do as much covid friendly stuff as possible, so mainly outdoor activities, but are open to some indoors stuff while taking appropriate precautions.

   We've only really ever been to Vegas, Las Angeles, and Newport Beach CA. As far as AZ, we've been to the Grand Canyon, Sedona, Flagstaff, and Payson. Going back to any of those places would be fine, but somewhere new would be nice.

   Given that info, where would you suggest we go? Also, when you plan a trip, do you drive to a place over a few days then stay and do stuff there, then drive back home? Or do you drive to a new area every day or two? If you drive to New places, how do you plan your sleeping arrangements? Do you pre-reserve rooms? Or do you do it day of or day before? The farthest we've driven is 6 hours in a straight shot to Cali, so we have no real ""road trip"" experience.","Looking for suggestions, starting point Glendale AZ.","   My wife and I have been planning to take a vacation sometime in May or June.

Hello!

So I got a kitten a few weeks ago and he's been incredible. My goal is for him to be an adventure kitty who is leash taught and can possibly go camping with me in the future. Leash training has been very easy so far and we go on regular walks outside. He has no problems with wearing his harness at all but we still need to work on responding to my direction when we are walking. He is also already very comfortable with car rides! I sort of just let him explore for the most part or he'll just fall asleep in my lap. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with road tripping/ camping with cats and what advice they could share! I totally think my kitty has what it takes to be an adventurer and would love to know more about how I can help him. I have the opportunity to go for a trip soon and really want to bring him. I'm very torn about leaving him at home because I'm not sure if my roommate's will keep up with his training while I'm gone/ spend enough time with him.

So I’m planning a trip from Colorado Springs to the Black Canyons of the Gunnison in late March. I know it’s about a 4-5 hour drive. I’ve done million dollar highway and that was one beautiful but stressful drive. I’m 24 and that drive was enough to age me another year haha. Will I experience anything like that on my way to Gunnison? 

I plan on doing it as a day trip. You know? Leave early morning from CO springs. I’m thinking leaving around 5-6 AM and getting to the park around 9-10 AM and spending a few hours there then heading back.  I pray the weather is nice but I do know that there are closure if/when it snows. But some viewpoints are still usually accessible and I know the drive itself would probably be scenic. 

My question is what’s the drive like from Colorado Springs to Gunnison? I’ve never done it myself so I have no idea what to expect. Will be going in an SUV with 4x4 capabilities. 

Any advice would be appreciated!! Thanks in advance.",Planning a road trip from CO Springs to Black Canyon of the Gunnison in late March wondering if anyone here has experience with this trip.,"

I called a local branch, and they said because I'm 24 (I turned 25 in two months) I can't pay with a debit card.

I am sort of panicking because I have to be out of my house on the 28th. I saw on budget that they accept paypal, and I wonder if I could just load my paypal account with the rental amount and that would work. I am just scared that at someone point they will require a credit card.

From there I want to hit Vegas for a night or two, Joshua Tree from there and end in LA, possibly Palm Springs. I haven’t locked in where I’m flying out from yet. 

I potentially might add a stop in antelope canyon before Zion, but don’t want to add too much on my plate. I’d rather give myself ample time to explore a few places throughly as opposed to seeing little of multiple places. Again, any suggestions or thoughts would be appreciatedRoad trip Denver to LA",plan trip start denver end lo angel trip take place late septemb earli octob day drive sightse fli home advic recommend would appreci basic plan fli denver spend day two friend live denver first stop zion want hit vega night two joshua tree end la possibl palm spring lock fli yet potenti might add stop antelop canyon zion want add much plate rather give ampl time explor place throughli oppos see littl multipl place suggest thought would appreciatedroad trip denver la,0

I’m pretty open to anything, would like to see the Mississippi River, and New Orleans seems fun. But I’m also traveling solo, so I’m not sure if that’s the place for a guy traveling alone.

During the week I’ll be pretty much stuck on calls, etc.. but on weekends I’d be interested in sightseeing/hiking, nightlife, food, history.

roadtrip,"Hi, I recently accepted an internship for this summer in Anchorage, AK. I would like to have a vehicle there for both practical reasons and to see the area in my time off. I am only 20 so renting a car is not an option for me, and the cheapest quote for shipping my vehicle was about $2000 which isn’t practical for me. So I am considering making a road trip out of it and driving up there. 

It would either be me by myself or me and my girlfriend (depending on what her plans end up being this summer). The route I tentatively have planned starts in the Tulsa area, spend the night in Casper WY, then spend the night in Calgary AB, then the next night in Fort Nelson BC, the next night in Whitehorse YT, then finally Anchorage. This route should have a little over 2 and a half days of driving time spread out over five days to seven days (depending on if we stay multiple nights and any of the stops). The trip out would probably be in late May and the trip back in early August. 

Is this a good/realistic plan? I drive a very well maintained and in good condition 2013 F150 and will of course get it serviced/checked before making the trip. Do you think a solo/duo of 20 year olds can safely make this trip? Do you have any general advice for this trip? Thanks!

roadtrip,"I have OAB (overactive bladder), so that's kind of why I do this. 

Hey all! Figured I'd give some advice that my good friend Lilly taught me when going on road trips. So as you know, sometimes you can't stop the car, for whatever reason, to go and relieve yourself. Now, if you're a dude, then you can just go in a bottle, but unfortunately, due to how I'm made, going in a bottle, **while in a moving car, is close to impossible.** So here's what Lilly taught me.

What you do, before you get in the car, is go to the bathroom. Relieve yourself before you get in (should be obvious). Then, place some sort of absorbent pad between your crotch and underwear. Could be a towel, a liner, really anything. She used a spare diaper from her younger sister. What she did was she'd put it between her and her panties, right up against the crotch. You want to make sure it's nice and snug, so it doesn't fall out and you make a mess.

Then, you hop in the car, and just, do whatever. Eat, read, watch, sleep. If you feel the need to relieve yourself, just let go. You should be able to ""go"" at least twice before you need to replace it. But hopefully by then you'll be near some sort of rest stop.

I've done this in planes, road trips, all types of stuff. Just be careful shifting around, as to not move it to where it doesn't cover you. I like to place a blanket over me when I have it on, in case I need to shift it for any reason.

Now, if it's like a an hour or an hour and a half road trip, then really you should try to hold it until you get somewhere or can pull over (unless you have an OAB like me) , but if it's like a 3+ hour road trip, and you can't pull over at anytime (like on some interstates and highways) then this is for you. I have an overactive bladder, so longer road trips are always a complex thing.

I hope this helps!","Pro-Tip: If you have a small bladder, and are going on a long ride, consider bringing an absorbent pad.","I have OAB (overactive bladder), so that's kind of why I do this.

I’m supposed to leave early Friday morning, and I guess my biggest question is which route is safer/better? Generally I’d assume Texas but I know the big storm has that area kinda messed up right now. 

Going north im assuming the roads are salted/plowed better but higher chance of snow so idk. I do have some experience driving a whole winter but it’s been awhile. Which route has the better chance of ice/shitty roads?

roadtrip,"Hello, everyone! I'm hitting up this subreddit because I want to get some advice on how to break up a road trip from Boston to SLC.

For context: I am from SLC, but I have a friend who lives close to Boston who is going to move to SLC with me. I fly out to Boston in June, and then we are road-tripping the whole way back with just the two of us.

Do y’all have any recommendations on places to go / a route? I need to do more research but would love to hear some routes, tips, and tricks for a road trip around this area! Everything I see in terms of scenery in these states are beautiful and want to take on the opportunity to check it out.

roadtrip,"Just because there is no single perfect solution, I love seeing what people use to plan their trips.

I have found 2 key applications/sites that have served me very well on the motorcycle.  One is a web app, the other is iOS navigation app that can import directly from the webapp.

1. [**Furkot**](https://trips.furkot.com/)\- this thing is, hands down, the best planning software for motorcycles.  I use it with car routes as well, and it does great.  I change a few settings and it works just as well.  Now, you can use 90% of the functionality without paying, but $14 for a year is worth while.  You can plan room and gas and food stops directly in the route.
   1. Here is a short weekend route I am planning for the next few weeks when the ice disappears. [**To Red River Gorge**](https://trips.furkot.com/ts/mrohHs)

2. [**Scenic App**](https://scenicapp.space/) \- this is what I use on my phone to import routes I create in Furkot.  Nothing's perfect, and you do have to go in and make sure the route is correct.  Since I ride a motorcycle, I dont have a lot of time to concentrate on any screen, so I always double check.  It's not free, and it does require real money for the offline maps and certain import functions, but this one is the best one I have found and I have purchased the options.  Other apps can use Furkot routes, but you have to export from Furkot and import.  just an extra step.
3. [**Rever App**](https://www.rever.co/) \- Runner Up - This one is great, but not as detailed in the planning of the routes.  The interface on the web is a little clunky, but getting a subscription offers access to Butler maps online, which have some of the best and most detailed routes out there.  Worth a look if you havent seen/used it before.  And the App is easy to use and see.  Also, it has both Android and iOS apps, and works with Apple Car Play.  I havent tried that yet, but that functionality may move it to my number one.  I have exported from Furkot to Rever.

roadtrip,"Hey guys! Need some advice from y'all experienced road trippers. So I just unexpectedly got 6 days off work, starting this Friday. I'm looking to get out of Michigan and take a road trip. Starting and ending in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I'll be traveling alone with my dog. This is my first solo road trip. I have a reliable SUV. Because this is so last-minute, I am most likely going to sleep in my car or look for car camping options. Not interested in hotels/motels. Trying to make it cheap.

I am mostly wanting a change of scenery and would like to end up in a destination with mountains or variable topography of some sort. I am hoping to do some hiking/exploring/camping. Although it'd be super nice, I am not set on going somewhere warm, so I don't mind if I drive to a place that is cold/snowy.

Some other minor considerations:

I am currently doing a sober month, so I am not looking to stop at any cool breweries (also pandemic; big sad). I will probably bring most of my own food, but not opposed to getting takeout a couple times.

I am an online student so it would be helpful to have wi-fi access for at least a day or two out of the 6 days (I understand I can probably just stop at a coffee shop)

&amp;#x200B;

Some ideas I have:

* Badlands National Park &amp; Black Hills, SD (15-17hr drive)
   * Is this 15-17hr drive too unrealistic for my 6 day budget?
   * I've never driven through Wisconsin and Minnesota- would it be a nice, pretty drive?
* Great Smoky Mountains National Park (10hr drive)
* Asheville, NC (11hr drive)

**I am super open to any other ideas!**

I know 6 days is not a lot of time to go out and back, but I haven't left the state of Michigan in over a year and just want to go see some cool shit (while being socially distanced and responsible). I REALLY appreciate any advice or feedback! Thank you everyone!

Hi, fellow european here. This year i'll be saving up money so probably next summer i can roadtrip the good old us of a. Sorry for the cringey language. Still, wanted to ask you (the Americans) some questions (i'll give you some background). Feel free to only respond to the ones you can/want

1. What should my itinerary be? (broad question, keep in mind I'd just like to see the major cities as well as the best national parks spots and the trip should last 25 days to a month max. I'd be stopping in one place for 3-4 days max, I like to visit museums so ones such as Smithsonian/Guggenheim/MoMA are a must. On top of that I HAVE to go through Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks, matter of personal interest. The trip i thought i could take (very broad) was the northern route from NY to LA and back through the southern rote coming back. Last on this subject: the cities I would like to visit most are: NY city (i'd stay there some time), Washington DC (mainly fo the Smithsonian), LA, San Francisco, maybe Miami, maybe Vegas. Some other places i'd like to go through: Utah salt flats, Alabama and West Virginia (yes for the photos with the signs), some desert landscape (not much where i live) and some more northern state (so I see a bit of everything). 
2. How should I get a car? The obvious one would be to rent it (as much as I'd like to rent a vintage Mustang I don't need it/would probably cost too much so a Fiesta sized one will do just fine) but I thought to myself if just buying an old camry or corolla (or similar) wouldn't be cheaper. I'm not afraid to go through the hassle of buying and registering a car but the process is quite different from here in the EU so I'd have to look into it. If you think renting a car is better, where from? Are they all almost the same thing or is there a rental company that you think delivers best for the money or way better than the others for not much more?
3. Where should I stay? So, I really don't have high standards for where to sleep while travelling (my philosophy is spend little on accomodation so you have more for activities and things to do, places to see). I'd be willing (and wanting) to do quite some camping for most of the trip (not when I'm in cities obv) but Idk about the legality of it in the wild in the US (on the subject, things I have to be afraid of while camping). If you have better ideas (idk anything about motels but if you reckon they're a good option I'll consider them). In the cities I'll be staying in airbnbs (hate hotels).
4. Things I have to eat? What you think (don't argue too much plz) are the best places to eat at? (fast food but also special meals you can only get in one place) I'll spend a little bit more for a really good meal but also not Nobu please.
5. Places that aren't famous but you think would deserve it? (Mainly natural landscapes but also towns/cities that have something special or a particular history or museums that not many people know about) (btw is there a museum in Los Alamos?)
6. Legality of alcohol and recreational marijuana. My username ends in 420, not a coincidence. On a serious note, I like to have a beer from time to time and by the time I do this trip I'll probably be 21 so that shouldn't be an issue (btw how much can you drink if you drive (what is the alcohol concentration limit))? In which states can I buy weed, what age do I have to be and where can i consume it (especially as a foreigner)?

roadtrip,"A good friend and I, both 22, are planning a 3 week roadtrip through the West Coast. I live abroad and can fly to California, friend lives in Florida and can either drive his car or fly to California. We have three options for the roadtrip

Option 1) : 

I fly to LAX and he drives from Florida, meet up there, and do a 2 week roadtrip. Later, take 1 week to drive to Florida and visit places on the way. I leave The us From florida.

Pros: +No car renting                      Cons: -Significantly Longer in distance

\-19MPG Suv( might be as expensive as renting)

\-Might be too rushed for 3 weeks

Option 2) 

Same as before but I leave From Cali and friend drives back to Florida, We could spend 3 weeks in West coast total.

Option 3) Both of us fly to California and rent a car and do a 3 week roadtrip.

Pros: +Much less driving ( no Florida to California)             Cons: - Renting a car( we are 22, and probably  

will be overcharged)

What are you guys opinions?

Some extra info:

\-Mid budget, We are trying to keep costs down if possible, camping for some days is an option.

\-Both of us are 22, I have a foreign driver's license and he's got a US drivers license

\-My friend's car is 4x4 but it's also a gas guzzler

We also wanted to know about the following:

1) Do you have any stratergy/tips for Motels/hostels while roadtriping? what about camping? Do you reserve online or do it on the spot? How do you  get the best deals?

2) Tips on Renting a car, Were would your rent it, what type of car you recommend? Is it better to do it online or on person. Any tips on renting under 25, What sort of documentation requirement might they surprise us with.

3) We might also like to travel to Tijuana,Mexico Is it feaseable on a rented car? Is it perhaps a little dangerous of a place?

4)  How feaseable is camping? do you recommend it when in rural Areas ( Yosemite etc)

I live abroad and can fly to California, friend lives in Florida and can either drive his car or fly to California. We have three options for the roadtrip

Option 1) : 

I fly to LAX and he drives from Florida, meet up there, and do a 2 week roadtrip. Later, take 1 week to drive to Florida and visit places on the way. I leave The us From florida.

Pros: +No car renting                      Cons: -Significantly Longer in distance

\-19MPG Suv( might be as expensive as renting)

\-Might be too rushed for 3 weeks

Option 2) 

Same as before but I leave From Cali and friend drives back to Florida, We could spend 3 weeks in West coast total.

Option 3) Both of us fly to California and rent a car and do a 3 week roadtrip.

I'm posting to look for places to stay along this route. The first leg of the trip will be taking me to Austin, Texas to visit friends, then I will figure out a trip further West. I am starting from the Southeast coast of Florida. I don't want to drive more then 8 hours at a time. I will have to make 1 stop between Mobile Alabama and Panama Beach City. 

I've read about digital nomads doing this sort of thing, right now it seems possible to be safe with covid if you wear a mask, rent out places that are sanitized between visitors, and don't go to busy and reckless places.

Ideally, I'd like to find a place that's interesting, cheap, and has nice nature stuff. If it's a cool spot, I'll stay there for about 4 weeks and work from my laptop. If not, I will just find anywhere to stay the night, then hurry along to the next location. It would be cool to explore a nice area on the weekends and after work.

Eventually I want to explore westward from Austin, maybe even National Parks in Texas, but right now I want to see if the first leg of the trip has anything interesting.  I would consider taking a different route, maybe one that goes to the West Coast of Florida or even north into Georgia.

  
So, does anyone have any spots along the way here to check out? How about suggestions for this sort of thing?

roadtrip,"Greetings r/roadtrip!

I am here to ask for your feedback on my road trip itinerary-in-progress for this summer. My goal is to see the big name natural wonders, but also get off the beaten path as much as possible and spend as many nights as I can dispersed camping/backpacking. I will be traveling in my homemade truck bed camper setup and will also have my dog and another person with me. 

I’ll be leaving from Baltimore and basically going straight to Denver to pick up my girlfriend. From there the plan is to make a kinda wonky clockwise loop through Colorado, Utah, Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and then head back east. Here are the stops I’m thinking after Denver:

Week 1: Front range somewhere, Crestone in the Sangre de Cristo range, Arches, Bryce Canyon, Zion 

Week 2: Grand Canyon (just the rim (lol)), LA just for a sec, Sequoia, Sierra, Yosemite 

Week 3: Santa Cruz for a sec, PCH, Redwoods, Crater Lake, Olympic 

Week 4: Nez Perce NF, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, Wind River range 


This gives you an idea of the kinds of things I want to do, but I am also looking for suggestions that would be similar, but lesser-known, less crowded, and more dog-friendly. 

What did I miss? What is over-hyped? What is kinda more of the same and so I could pick one or the other? What should I absolutely NOT miss? 


Thanks everybody!

roadtrip,"Planning a 3 or 4 day road trip in late March. Would love your advice, as I have never been to Texas before. My main interests are art and Americana, but want to do a beautiful hike too. On the cheap - camping or sleeping in the car. Please note I already had Covid and should have had my first shot of the vaccine by then.   


Day 0 - Fly into San Antonio, make my way to Bandera where I meet my friend at around 9pm. Spend the night at a cowboy bar? 

Day 1 - Cowboy stuff in morning. 6-hour drive to Marfa, stopping en route for kitsch and fun things. Stay in ???

Day 2 - Most of the day in Marfa. Then to Presidio and Santa Elena Canyon for sunset. 

Day 3 - Morning in Big Bend. 8 hour drive to Austin, where I will be spending the next few days

roadtrip,"Hi all.

I accepted a job offer last week, and will therefore be moving from Central Oregon to Chicago, Illinois next week. I realize this is perhaps the worst time of year to be driving across the country. I will be driving a 2015 Ford Fiesta SE Hatchback with all-season tires and a Thule cargo box on the roof. I'm trying to decide which route to take now, considering the weather and road conditions, as a drive over the course of 3 days (16th-18th).

**Route 1 |1998 miles | 30 Hours**: the most direct. Down to Salt Lake City and then take I-80 all the way to Chicago.

**Route 2 | 2391 miles|36 Hours**: Slightly southern. Down to Salina, Utah, and then across on I-70 to St. Louis before then heading North to Chicago.

**Route 3 | 2892 miles | 43 hours**: Very far South. To avoid as much snow as possible, I go to Salina, UT, and then cut down to New Mexico and head North once reaching Memphis.

I'm nervous that my car won't handle cold weather and snowy highways well, and given the terrible conditions on I-80 last week and 40 car pile up, am now considering Routes 2 and 3. I am leaning towards Route 2 since it's the best compromise and I've been told I-70 is pretty consistently cleared.

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of you have experience driving on these roads this time of year, and do you have any advice? Do any of you live in Wyoming, Nebraska, or Iowa, and can you speak to the current road conditions? I've been checking online traffic cameras and other State resources, but am trying to get all the information I can. Do you think my FWD car could handle the roads right now, or should I add 1000 miles to the trip, which seems ridiculous but potentially necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

I want to find some hidden gems, not really touristy areas.

I am not sure how accessible the pacific crest trail is on my trip, but I am down for anything hiking, in the woods, waterfalls, great geocaches.

It will probably be a solo trip.

I am trying to get outside as much as possible this summer, and to do that I've decided to do some major road tripping across the West. I'm trying to mostly camp to keep costs down and mostly hike to hopefully stay away from people because of the pandemic.

roadtrip,"Hi! I'm living in Northern California and have not had much chance to travel domestically outside the West Coast. A cross-country road trip has always been on my bucket list.

Sometime this Spring I will need to fly to my sister's new place near Lexington, KY to return her cats which I've been caring for during her move. So I will have to fly in that direction, but I'm thinking that for the return trip it may be a good opportunity to rent a car and see some of the country on my way back to CA.

I don't have a clear idea yet of what route I'd like to take, but I'm interested in seeing deserts and canyons (so maybe some of the SW and/or Utah?) and less interested in long, flat stretches of farmland (which is what I hear much of the highway in the Midwest is like). I don't really need to drive up the California coast because I make that trip every year to see family.

My questions are:

\- What route would you recommend given the preferences above?

\- How much time should I budget for this trip?

\- Is it advisable to make such a trip during the pandemic? I'll obviously be in my car most of the time, but I expect there will be some attractions along the way. Will these be open/safe to visit, or should I plan this trip for another time so I don't miss out on any memorable stops?

The thing is I worry about safety cause I'm 23F and so is my friend... being young women alone can get a little spooky sometimes. If its significantly safer then I may put up the money to rent the trailer rather than sleep in my car. Any specific areas that have given you bad/unsafe experiences that you recommend avoiding?

roadtrip,"Hi all,

As part of my imminently forthcoming road trip, I have some questions about New Mexico (specifically in mid-Feb) that I’m looking for some feedback on:

I’ll be coming from the East (Amarillo area), via I40 / 285 / I25 (potentially stopping at Pecos NHP en route).

My plan is to spend the afternoon / evening in Santa Fe proper.

The following day, I’d like to take the High Road up into Taos. (I’m from New England and have an AWD vehicle—I’m used to driving in snow—but it’s for me to tell what type of conditions to expect and whether the “high road” is maintained in winter—I haven’t seen anything to the contrary, but wanted to confirm). I understand the Pueblo is closed due to Covid. I’d like to see the Taos historic district, shops/restaurants, Rio Grande del Norte Monument / bridge and Earthship Visitor’s Center, ~~spending the night at Ojos Caliente. To get to Ojos, it looks like I can take W Rim Rd. (Between the Monument and Earthship) to County Rd CB-115, pick up 567 in Carson to 285 or head further West on 64 and pick up 285S in Tres Piedras. This cuts out Route 68 (the “River Road”)—am I missing out on something spectacular in so doing?~~ Edit--had my Ojos confused--this location is closed.

I’d like to See Bandelier and Valles Caldera National Monuments.  I could loop back through Los Alamos and follow 502 back to 84/285 into Santa Fe and pick up 25 (OR I could follow 4 through Jemez Springs and pick up 550 in San Isidro) making my way into Albuquerque to see Petroglyph National Monument and maybe ride the tram to Sandia peak.

I imagine either will take most of the day and I’ll need to spend the night in Albuquerque or near vicinity.  (Recommendations welcome.  Descriptions of Albuquerque to date largely gravitate towards...""interesting...""

The next day I’d like to make it to Petrified Forest. I’ve heard I40 (Rte 66) is pretty awesome with lots of derelictia to explore en route. The alternative would be to take 53S in Grants to see El Malpais National Monument (potentially the ice cave/Bandera volcano which appear closed (at least what seems to be the visitor’s center)), El Morro National Monument, the Zuni Cliff Dwellings and pick up 602 to loop back to I40 in Gallup. This detour appears to add another hour of drive time, plus stops, but looks totally worth it.

Any feedback is great appreciated!

roadtrip,"Hello everyone!

I'm thinking about visiting the USA for the first time in the summer of 2022 or 2023. I will travel with my brother and my mother, who is not very old but tends to get tired easily. I haven't laid out a full plan yet, I'm just wondering about whether the ideas I have floated around so far are feasible.

We'd like to visit New York and then go to Chicago to meet some friends who live there. I think experiencing the USA on the road is one of the things that make you understand more about that country, so I'd be willing to spend 2 or 3 days on the road to Chicago. I plan on doing something like this:

\- Fly to NY and spend 3 full days there (this means 4 or 5 days including jet lag adjustment, transfer from the airport and car rental upon leaving)

\- Road trip: 2 or 3 days. I thought about seeing Niagara Falls but I'm not sure about timing and visas required to cross the Canadian border. Is there anything else worth seeing along the way?

I'm thinking about visiting the USA for the first time in the summer of 2022 or 2023. I will travel with my brother and my mother, who is not very old but tends to get tired easily. I haven't laid out a full plan yet, I'm just wondering about whether the ideas I have floated around so far are feasible.

We'd like to visit New York and then go to Chicago to meet some friends who live there. I think experiencing the USA on the road is one of the things that make you understand more about that country, so I'd be willing to spend 2 or 3 days on the road to Chicago. I plan on doing something like this:

\- Fly to NY and spend 3 full days there (this means 4 or 5 days including jet lag adjustment, transfer from the airport and car rental upon leaving)

\- Road trip: 2 or 3 days. I thought about seeing Niagara Falls but I'm not sure about timing and visas required to cross the Canadian border. Is there anything else worth seeing along the way?

roadtrip,"Ladies and gents, good day. I created an account specifically for this. Not a previous reddit user at all. Now here's my thing. We're from Dallas. My wife and I have a four year old girl and we want her to be able to play in some snow so we have tentatively decided on Durango mid February. Why Durango? Suggestion from a friend is all. I'm open to better spots in CO. We aren't skiers, just wanting to get messy in as much snow as possible. 

So here's our planned route because, while this trip is ultimately for the eventual snow, there are a couple things the wife and I want to do. First we're heading to Carlsbad, NM for the caverns. I've been when I was in high school, 25 years ago, and my wife has never been and wants to go badly. We'll spend a day there. From there we'll drive north through Roswell. Only want to spend 3-4 hours there max and maybe pick up a shirt and possibly some museum or something. From there it's off to northern NM to maybe Albuquerque or Santa Fe or something. This is where our trip is a little less planned and a little more open. If we can find a good amount of snow in either of those places maybe the trek to CO isn't needed. Maybe we'll go anyway. 

One question I have to you guys is this. Is there an app or a way to find out if there is snow and how much is on the ground currently in a particular location? This could help us immensely in the planning of our road trip. 

second is this. If we decide to go from ABQ into Durango does anyone know what the roads are typically like, let's say on 550 heading into town? I'm worried that my all-season tires may not be sufficient. Plenty of tread as the SUV is only 3 months old but I just don't have the experience driving in snow that much being from Dallas. 

Any thoughts on anything so far? I'm trying to be fairly efficient but I don't want to over plan and be on some strict schedule either. We have a full week plus the weekends so I think there is more than enough time. We'll be leaving Saturday, Feb 13 and would Like to return on the 20th to give us a day to unwind and prepare for the next work week","Dallas - Durango, CO with spots in between","Ladies and gents, good day.

I'm currently planning a big trip across the united states for around 6 months.

The plan is to start my trip around December 10th from Boston and finish in Yosemite park around may, but nothing is set in stone.  


I'm planning to drive a lot so I decide the best thing for me is to get a car, renting is not really an option because I'll be 22 and rental companies charge a high fee.  


So I'm currently researching buying a car. 

I'm having a hard time understanding how can I register the car so everything is legal and safe.   
I will buy insurance that will cover anything that the state I'm buying the vehicle in requires.

I'm currently planning a big trip across the united states for around 6 months.

The plan is to start my trip around December 10th from Boston and finish in Yosemite park around may, but nothing is set in stone.  


I'm planning to drive a lot so I decide the best thing for me is to get a car, renting is not really an option because I'll be 22 and rental companies charge a high fee.  


So I'm currently researching buying a car. 

I'm having a hard time understanding how can I register the car so everything is legal and safe.   
I will buy insurance that will cover anything that the state I'm buying the vehicle in requires.

roadtrip,"I poked around this subreddit for a while and didn't find the answers to my question, so: I'm planning my first roadtrip and have a few questions to help get me started:

1. How many hours a day do you recommend driving? I was thinking 4-5 hours/day, which should give me time to see something each day.

2. Do you even recommend daily tourism, or should I save my energy for a few extra-cool stops, and maybe go further?

2. I'm a young woman, I'll be traveling alone. Opinions on sleeping in my car, in terms of safety?

3. My car is a sports car. Opinions on sleeping in my car, in terms of comfort? 

I'm only planning on staying out for about a week. I want to go to the Serpent Mound Historical Site in Ohio, then turn around (5 hours driving a day would make the trip last exactly 7 days). I'm going to be very careful, since the virus doesn't show any signs of stopping yet, and might cancel all my plans if things still look too bad once summer arrives. I'd cry, but I'd do it lol.

roadtrip,"Hi there fellow gravel-travel enthusiasts. Starting in August, I'm considering spending \~12mo. doing a long-term, slower-paced road trip around the US while I work remotely. I already have a car, and I'm planning to stay mostly at AirBnB's (maybe some hotels if its cheaper). I'm hoping to stay flexible with how long I stay in each location — at least a week, but no longer than six weeks (unless it's really cheap and awesome). I'm mostly wanting to see a combination of cool cities and nice natural areas across the US.

Just to address the elephant in the comments section — while I appreciate people's concern about the virus and the risks involved, I'm very closely monitoring the situation and all of this is contingent upon a high-degree of safety (for myself and others). Worst case, your lovely advice will be helpful long after the virus has retreated its ugly head. So, for the purposes of this post, **please keep your pessimism and shaming to a respectful minimum :)** 

Anyways, I'm looking for some tips and/or recommendations on a few specific topics:

# Places to See?

I'm expecting every stop on my trip to fit into (at least) one of these three categories, and I'd love recs for places that fit into any of them:

1. **Cool Cities** — I love exploring cities (especially more walkable ones) with a nice vibe, nice architecture, and nice public areas/parks. Since I'll be working remotely during the week, I expect to spend a decent amount of time in cities so I'll have reliable wifi/LTE. I'd love recs for smaller cities/towns that have a nice vibe too. 
2. **Beautiful** **Natural Areas** — I'm not exactly interested in seeing EVERY US National Park (like the STL Arch... really?), but I would really love to use this year to see some of the more beautiful natural areas in the US. I lived in LA for a few years, so I've seen most of Southern/Central California, but I'm interested in seeing everywhere else! 
3. **Seeing Friends!** — Don't necessarily need recs here... but if you want to be friends and hang out, I'm there for it :) 

Putting those together, the ideal kind of place I'm looking to use as a base for a few weeks at a time would be a cool city/town that is within driving distance of some awesome parks and natural areas!

# Tips for Long-Term Road Trip

If any of y'all have done a longer-term road trip like this, and have any general tips that would be very welcome! I'd especially love advice on:

* **Useful things to bring that you might not think of?**
* **Useless things that most people probably bring?**
* **How to balance constant travel with relaxation/comfort?** More of a subjective thing, but I'm open to suggestions!
* **Tips for taking care of a car?** Not expecting to put crazy miles on it every day, but over a year I'll probably rack em' up.

roadtrip,"Made a throwaway because I have not been keeping the plans of this roadtrip secret from friends and look forward to sharing some cool pics with the community once underway. Anyways I'm planning a roadtrip one way from San Diego to Chicago late March through early April but planning on taking the scenic route and taking my sweet time with it. Haven't been to the mainland (currently in Hawaii) since covid hit and I understand different states are different levels of locked down. 

I'm planning on camping or car camping as much as possible with some hotel nights thrown in, but I know most campgrounds are shut down so I'm thinking either stealth camping or parking lots if I must. Never taken on a true road trip and looking forward to it, I've only ever driven distance to make good time A to B. For the first time in my adult life I don't really have a time hack I have to make so I may adjust as I go and just go where the road takes me. Planning on stopping at a lot of national/state parks along the way for sight seeing and some hiking as long as they're open. 

I drive a 2015 Jeep Patriot which has enough room for me to lay down in the back if I move the passenger seat up. Also have camping gear and a lot of camping experience. I'm not very acclimated to the cold right now but I'm from Chicago so I know how to live and drive in winter conditions. Just got 4 new tires for my car and it has no mechanical issues. 

Any advice on or input for the sleeping arrangements would be much appreciated. Funds aren't much of an issue but I'm not planning on being extravagant either.

roadtrip,"Hi all. I got great confidence and empowerment from reading everyone’s reports and advice last summer and eventually did my lockdown socially distant cross country trip and all went amazingly well including not catching covid and yes doing the mandatory quarantine upon re entry to NYC (we take covid seriously and I played everything by the book as much as I could altho obviously traveling per se was not exactly the best thing to do but still, ok, we did it safely)

I’m all watery eyed about what my wonderful son and I achieved together this summer and would love to share. I’m a single mom, so it was just me driving each day and putting up the tent each night whilst my son ‘rested’ 😂 and tried to find WiFi 😩 but the memories last a lifetime. I also fell in love with my adopted country. I hope to inspire others. 

Our route was as follows:

Day 1. NYC to PA to pick up my son from his Dad
PA to Marengo, Ohio, to a farm campsite.

Day 2. Marengo Ohio to Macoupin county, southern Illinois: an animal sanctuary offering camping on their grounds. 

Day 3. Illinois to Lake of the Ozarks and Osage beach for lunch (we’d just watched Ozark so it was kinda work the detour). Another farm campsite in Edgerton MO that night. 

Day 4. MO to Kansas (Manhattan, albeit a very different Manhattan to that we know ha ha) we stayed on a kind of bush skills education site! Very cool. 

Day 5. We break the back of the flat parts of the Midwest and whoah, the most amazing amazing farm campsite in southern Nebraska in a place called Gering! 

Day 6. Nebraska into Wyoming via Cheyenne, and then across the snowy ranges pass into Colorado. The most beautiful day of driving ever. Tears were shed on the snowy pass! Night 6 at a glamping location in Steamboat Springs CO.

Day 7. CO to Utah!! Overnight at a remote but amazing campsite in the Canyonlands NP.

Day 8. Canyonlands down to Zion. Overnight at an rV park next to Zion.

Day 9: Vegas baby. Hotel. Didn’t like it after being in so many scenic locations queuing for coffee with non mask wearing covid deniers wasn’t to our liking so we left early and drove back to Utah to Zion and hired a cowboy cabin for a few nights of R and R. No more queuing for coffee! 

Day 13. Zion to Riverton Wyoming to an awesome ranch. Again we were alone camping very safely and had a wonderful time.

Day 14. Cody Wyoming. My son is a Kanye fan. But didn’t make the link. Shucks. 

Day 15. Cody Wyoming to badlands SD.

Day 16. Hotel overnight in Milwaukee.

roadtrip,"Hi! So this is my *very* first time posting anything on Reddit, so I'm not very confident but here goes nothing:

I'm taking a class called **Engineering Design and Development** and I have a project to *identify a problem, justify it, find a possible solution, and develop a prototype*. The problem I *want* to do is something I *definitely* would like solved **but** I don't know if there's a market out there for it.

My family frequently takes long road trips across the states in our family suburban\*, often going through the night, and it gets really tiring and hard to find a comfortable position to kind of lie down and somewhat sleep. The seatbelt always gets in the way no matter what I try, but I **do not** want to unbuckle and put my life at risk (*though if anything does happen, I highly doubt it would be the fault of whoever's driving our suburban*). Either the shoulder strap is cutting into my neck; prevents me from lying across the bench-seat (I don't actually know what it's called. the double seat that's behind the driver's); or the buckle digs into my hip, no matter which seat I'm sitting in.

Does anyone else have this problem or is it just my autistic butt that has it? What do you guys think?

\**I attached some pictures of the suburban*

Hi Everyone - my husband and I are planning a trip for his 40th birthday in July. It will be the two of us and our 10 year old. We plan to fly into Flagstaff or Phoenix and depart from Reno. We are aiming to do this Saturday-Saturday but could add a day or two if needed.

This is our tentative itinerary -

1. **Saturday, July 3rd**  \- fly into Phoenix or Flagstaff, spend the night in Flagstaff, AZ
2. **Sunday, July 4th** \- Drive from Flagstaff to Grand Canyon National Park (1hr 45) – Spend day at Grand Canyon, drive halfway to Santa Monica (7hr total) and stay for the night.
3. **Monday, July 5th -**  Drive the rest of the way to Santa Monica - spend the day at the beach at stay somewhere nearby
4. **Tuesday, July 6th -** Drive to to Sequoia National Park (3.5hrs) and explore for a bit. Drive to Yosemite National Park (3.5hrs) and spend the night in the Yosemite area.
5. **Wednesday, July 7th** · Explore Yosemite National Park in the morning and drive to San Francisco (4hrs) in the afternoon. Spend night in SF.
6. **Thursday, July 8th**  Explore San Francisco in day and drive to Lake Tahoe in afternoon (3hr, 15mn) to spend the night.
7. **Friday, July 9th -** Spend day at Lake Tahoe, drive to Reno (1hr) to stay the night
8. **Saturday, July 10th** \- fly out of Reno

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Is this way too much? Am I being overly ambitious? The only day we should be in the car for more than 5 hours is Day 4 (Tuesday). Most days are around 3.5 hours. Do we need a full day of no driving? If so, where should we squeeze that in?
2. We are renting a car. We plan on getting a RAV-4. Will this be okay for traveling to all of these places? Safety is obviously the concern here, not comfort.
3. Anything we should cross off the list or add to it?

Thanks so much for any advice/suggestions! This is our first time doing a road trip like this and our first time in all three states, so I'm all ears.",Summer trip : Grand Canyon &gt; Santa Monica &gt; Sequoia &gt; Yosemite &gt; San Francisco &gt; Lake Tahoe,"&amp;#x200B;

roadtrip,"I’m hoping this is an/the appropriate place for this type of posting. Suggestions and guidance welcome as I’m (evidently) new at this.

The culmination of circumstance and coincidence have (not so) subtly indicated that the time is nigh for me to finally set off on all the adventures that have heretofore seemingly remained just out of reach on some distant horizon.

I’m 40, single, have lived what I consider to be an interesting life, have a successful and flexible career and I’m looking for one or more people who might be in a similar situation—seeking a reliable, honorable, genuine, funny, creative and interesting companion to share the trails, the road and the adventure with.

In the short-term (next \~9 months), I’m looking at some weekend / week long trips, given the present travel limitations and restrictions. Depending on how things shake up with work in the coming weeks, that could also include a month+ road trip. Towards the end of this year, I’m looking to embark on something semi-permanently, though I’m still defining what that will look like. One thing for certain, it will (at long last) include a winter spent elsewhere than New England.

I’m presently located in Boston.

It would be really cool if you were somewhere in New England.

**Here are a few things to know about me:**

* I’m ambitious, have a ton of energy (for adventure) and really enjoy the outdoors.
* I enjoy a wide range of interests/hobbies. We won’t run out of things to talk about anytime soon.
* People have a hard time describing me—I defy most paradigms, standards and norms.
* I’m a planner, insofar as I don’t want to find that I missed out on something incredible because I didn’t realize I’d be driving by it—or find out 8 miles into the backcountry that we didn’t bring the toilet paper. I’m not, however, someone who enjoys having every moment of every day planned out.
* I’ve put a lot of focus on being a good communicator and am fortunate to have met a few folks that have really enabled some good habits around that, specific to the circumstances of travel—being thrust into close quarters with a relative stranger in short time—and making it work, even when things get tough.
* I meditate, every morning, and I work to consciously be mindful. Grateful and present.
* I’m not looking for a relationship, but I’ve found my personality and interests are more aligned with women than men.
* I have a ton of gear, have spent a number of years involved in a number of outdoor pursuits am resourceful with finding good deals.
* I’m told I’m a great friend—reliable, dependable and thoughtful.
* I have an appreciation for old things--traditions, civilizations, literature, rituals and relics of bygone eras.
* I really like to see the sunset, whenever possible.
* I have been playing “name that tune” since I was old enough to remember music. You’ve been warned.

**So what’s on my list?**

* Pretty much anything outside, preferably temperate with more daylight than Boston.
* Lots of National Parks
* Many classic/epic hikes up to 2 weeks in duration.
* A pile of pages torn from Backpacker magazine with hikes and places I want to go.
* Alaska—the parts where you need a bush plane.
* Once the borders reopen, anything and everything overseas—I’ve only been to Iceland, Mexico and the Caribbean.

In the meantime, I’m big into winter hiking, am obsessed with trying “hot tenting” and I’d only need a reason to get on a plane to go anywhere South and West of Boston, at a moment’s notice.

TLDR: Have a flexible work arrangement (or similarly disinterested with “the grind” and need an escape) and want to travel with (arguably) the best companion you can find this side of the internet? Let’s chat.

\*\*Update\*\* (I tried adding as a comment, but alas, Reddit just kept the wheel a spinning...)

With the culmination of circumstance and coincidence, life has delivered me roughly 4 weeks between jobs. As soon as this winter storm system moves through New England in the coming days, I'm heading South and Southwest, roughly along this itinerary.

Intended stops, thus far, include:

* New River Gorge
* Shenandoah
* Congaree
* Hot Springs
* Abilene
* Big Bend
* Guadalupe Mountains / Carlsbad Caverns
* White Sands
* Saguaro
* Prescott, AZ
* Sedona
* Falgstaff
* (Maybe Grand Canyon)
* Petrified Forest
* Chaco Culture NHP
* Albuquerque
* Taos
* Amarillo
* Robber's Cave
* Eureka Springs
* Mammoth Cave

I've been reading recent trip reports and adding to my plans, accordingly. If anyone has any recommendations for must-see or off-the-beaten-path places, I'm all ears.

Likewise, if you're a fellow traveler and intend to be in/around any of these areas in the coming weeks, perhaps we could plan to cross paths and share a (socially distanced) cocktail or meal along the way.

First I want to thank everyone who commented with advice, but specially u/candres, u/Palindromer101, u/kmwilliams75, u/traveller22, u/211logos, u/bpsnoopy, u/yort410, u/CarbonGod, u/StDandtheChinchilla, u/leehawkings and u/OchoC,  your comments and tips, at some point or another helped us -a lot!-

The trip developed into a bit more than a road trip, we arrived through Miami, and spent a week on the east coast visiting family. We then flew to Chicago, we had booked a roomette in the California Zephyr, stocked up on snacks and wine and off we went to Sacramento. The trip with the Zephyr was amazing, I cannot recommend it enough!

Below I will post some general insights but [first, a few pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2Aj5HbnmUKMrAfmY8)!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Had an amazing trip, people were wonderful, loved every second of it, fellow roadtrippers tips were a huge plus!

&amp;#x200B;

**Planning and Budget**

We planned the trip on [Furkot (itinerary here)](https://trips.furkot.com/ts/cudw4v), thanks to u/CarbonGod for suggesting it!

I first made a plan with all the suggestions I got and then tuned it. Furkot was really incredible, I checked possible stays and places to eat.

I made an excel sheet with a budget, based on what I found on Furkot for stays and the fixed prices for tickets.

I made a budget of about 5.000 USD (not included was the car rental, the plane tickets and the zephyr ticket), for both of us. It kept quite well, this included also what we spent before the actual roadtrip. The most expensive part by far was the time in the east coast.

Daily expenses on the actual road trip added up to about 300USD/day, for a total of around 4000USD. This includes everything: stays, foods, entrance tickets, coffees, souvenirs, anything and all we spent during the 13 days. We splurged when we wanted to, ate where we wanted to, stayed (mostly) where we wanted to.

A note on the Lonely Planet California Guide, I had gotten it as a present, don't even bother. It is outdated, and led us to book the worst stay of the whole trip (Big Mountain Lodge in Tahoe - the worst!).

**Car Rental**

I had booked and paid for everything in advance in a deal with the plane tickets. I had contacted my travel insurance to hear about additional insurances I might need, and they said do not get anything, we cover it all. When I got to the rental place, they of course tried to push insurance and made me scared enough to get it. At this point I couldn't call my company due to the time difference and just bit the bullet. I would say that this was the biggest unexpected expense (400USD), but I managed to get a deal on a better car with GPS (which I was very happy about) and some other ""free"" extras.

Updated information from the insurance is: Make sure the rental contract specifies a deductible, otherwise get the lowest level of insurance and we cover the rest.

We got an automatic GMC Acadia which my boyfriend refused to drive due to it being automatic, so I was designated driver for the whole trip, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hotel Bookings**

Before the trip, I had a horrible anxiety about not having booked things in advance. This was really unnecessary and not worth it, we had so much freedom and flexibility and we didn't blow our budget. Plus, I was able to book last minute stays at two of my wish-list places: Yosemite Valley and the Benton Hot Springs! We never had to sleep in the car.

&amp;#x200B;

**Journaling**

I had gotten inspired by some old family trip albums and decided to keep a journal.

I collected brochures, receipts, tickets, stickers, whatever I could get my hands on for free, and bought a few choice things. I used ziploc bags to keep all this stuff organized, marking it with day of trip and location.

I managed to journal a few times once the roadtrip started, but it was not a realistic every day activity. I did most of it at home and I am not even done, Furkot, the organized ziplocs and the geolocation of the pictures helps a lot when sitting down to write. I did manage to journal quite a bit on the train though (before the roadtrip).

I stocked up on journaling and other supplies, some from home, some I ordered through Amazon to be picked up while East.

The list of things and its usefulness:

* Blank journals - filled one and a half, and I am not done writing yet!
* Colored fine liners
* Cannon Ivy mini photo printer: this was so good, I could pick 2-3 pictures for every day and print and stick on the journal, also could give them as souvenirs to family along the way
* Glue stick and scissors - I cut and pasted brochures, maps, scraps and text into the journal
* A sturdy bag to keep all the small stuff collected along the way and ziplocs

&amp;#x200B;

**Supplies**

* Physical version of a California Map - we used it very little as generally there was good coverage
* Ipad - we used it a little for navigation when the car's GPS didn't work, used it for music in the car, hotel bookings, reading and watching movies (we did very little of the two latter)

We stocked up at Walmarts, using some common sense and the tips provided by u/CarbonGod, u/bpsnoopy and u/Palindromer101 we had made a list and a budget of 150US, which we managed to keep. This is roughly what we got:

&amp;#x200B;

* Towels -never really needed them, but now I have two super fluffy towels
* Fleece throw - used it for sitting down on the ground
* Two small pillows - never really used them, we thought maybe if we needed to stay in the car
* Disposable plates, cutlery and cups - very useful for our many picnics
* A fanny pack/shoulder bag - I had a leather bag with me, but soon realized the strap was super uncomfortable, so this was great.
* Cooler and ice - a must, it was very easy to get ice anywhere, either at motels/hotels or stores
* Paper towels, wet wipes and tp - Super useful, the one item that was least used was the TP, we found well stocked and tidy bathrooms everywhere (except Yosemite Valley)
* A crate of water and drinks - This was super nice, we never had to buy any water, just open the back and get some ice-cold drinks.
* Food for picnics: bread, sauces, pickles, salad, fresh fruit, cheese, ham - We enjoyed so much stopping anywhere we felt like for a bite, and we saved a ton of money in food. We did have at least one meal a day at a restaurant.
* Road snacks - beef jerky, unhealthy delicious American stuff you cannot get here, energy bars...
* Personal care items: soap, shampoo, conditioner - always useful!
* First aid kit - we didn't have any issues, except my altitude sickness in Mammoth.
* Ziploc bags - This was very useful for keeping things dry in the cooler, but also for organizing all the brochures, stickers and crap I collected along the way. I marked each bag with dates and places, so when I sat down to journal it was very easy to figure out things.
* Trash bags - we strove to leave every place, in the same condition or better than we found it, so this was very very important. We carried the trash in the car until we found an appropriate place for disposal.
* Wine - We stocked up on wines where we could, so we could have a glass in the evenings. American supermarkets are weird, the variety of wines is not good. The best place we found was (in terms of price and variety) the Grocery Outlet in Mammoth, the cleaning lady at the hotel suggested it. We also visited many tasting rooms in Murphys!

Things that I didn't buy but wish I did:

* Laundry soap and softener/drier sheets - We ended up washing clothes several times and had to buy the expensive miniature stuff. I don't know why we didn't think of it.
* Headlight - would have been useful while walking in the dark, specially in Yosemite.

We stocked up every few days, we didn't need more ice every day.

**Meals**

In average, we ate ""out"" at least once everyday, we never opted out of ""too expensive"" if that is what we wanted to eat. We relied a lot on our supplies and picnics, we enjoyed it thoroughly, there are so many beautiful random places to stop along the way: Folsom Lake, Lake Tahoe shores, the banks of Stanislaus river in Calaveras, Columbia, Yosemite, June Lake....

We soon remembered about the size of portions in the US when we couldn't finish our meals and many times we shared one portion.

**Coffee**

This requires a special mention. We are not such big coffee drinkers, but the morning cup is a must.  It was hard to find good coffee in the hotels/motels. We kept a coffee diary too, for the most part it was awful, except at coffee shops. The little bags of coffee provided at the places we stayed to make on the coffee maker were truly horrible, not even using more quantity could we get some flavor out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights**

* Most memorable meal: it is a tie between breakfast at the Getaway Cafe in Tahoe (the link is sadly expired, they do have a FB page though) and [Coppertop BBQ](https://www.coppertopbbq.com/) (thanks u/candres!!), special mention to the homemade Jalapeño poppers at the [Crazy Horse Saloon](http://crazyhorsenc.com/) in Nevada City - they were H O T!
* Best stays: there is also a competition here:

1. [Benton Hot Springs](https://www.bentonhotsprings.us/), looking at the stars in a ghost town in the desert, while soaking in a hot tub was magic!
2. Waking up in Yosemite Valley (we scored a ""Donald Duck"" tent, last minute in Curry Village)
3. [Murphys Historic Hotel](http://murphyshotel.com/), we loved it so much (the town and the hotel) we stayed an extra night. We met the hotel attendant, Bruce, a historian, who kindly took us on a tour of the old rooms, and told us the story of the hotel's ghost, Eleanor. We had dinner at the hotel and it was very good also, the service altogether was amazing. They were also the ONLY hotel to provide excellent coffee!!!

* Best unexpected detours: we had not planned for Murphys, and we loved it so much see above.
* Best sights: too many to count, sunset at Glacier Point was magical, Bodie was incredible (thanks u/candres, u/211logos, u/bpsnoopy and u/OchoC
* Best coffee: [Peet's coffee](https://www.peets.com/) in Yosemite by a LONG shot.
* Driving highlights (super fun!): Alabama Hills, Glacier Point after dark, Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, road to Bodie.
* Worst stay: Big Pines Mountain House in Tahoe. Fits the definition of a roach motel to a t. Dirty shits, dirty room, dingy everything. Utterly disgusting.
* Worst coffee: all of the coffee in the hotels, except Murphys.
* Worst meal: we had meals that were forgettable, but none that were bad.

Now onto planning some more, I will post for some suggestions soon!

I made an excel sheet with a budget, based on what I found on Furkot for stays and the fixed prices for tickets.

I made a budget of about 5.000 USD (not included was the car rental, the plane tickets and the zephyr ticket), for both of us. It kept quite well, this included also what we spent before the actual roadtrip. The most expensive part by far was the time in the east coast.

Daily expenses on the actual road trip added up to about 300USD/day, for a total of around 4000USD. This includes everything: stays, foods, entrance tickets, coffees, souvenirs, anything and all we spent during the 13 days. We splurged when we wanted to, ate where we wanted to, stayed (mostly) where we wanted to.

A note on the Lonely Planet California Guide, I had gotten it as a present, don't even bother. It is outdated, and led us to book the worst stay of the whole trip (Big Mountain Lodge in Tahoe - the worst!).

**Car Rental**

I had booked and paid for everything in advance in a deal with the plane tickets. I had contacted my travel insurance to hear about additional insurances I might need, and they said do not get anything, we cover it all. When I got to the rental place, they of course tried to push insurance and made me scared enough to get it. At this point I couldn't call my company due to the time difference and just bit the bullet. I would say that this was the biggest unexpected expense (400USD), but I managed to get a deal on a better car with GPS (which I was very happy about) and some other ""free"" extras.

Updated information from the insurance is: Make sure the rental contract specifies a deductible, otherwise get the lowest level of insurance and we cover the rest.

We got an automatic GMC Acadia which my boyfriend refused to drive due to it being automatic, so I was designated driver for the whole trip, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hotel Bookings**

Before the trip, I had a horrible anxiety about not having booked things in advance. This was really unnecessary and not worth it, we had so much freedom and flexibility and we didn't blow our budget. Plus, I was able to book last minute stays at two of my wish-list places: Yosemite Valley and the Benton Hot Springs! We never had to sleep in the car.

&amp;#x200B;

**Journaling**

I had gotten inspired by some old family trip albums and decided to keep a journal.

I collected brochures, receipts, tickets, stickers, whatever I could get my hands on for free, and bought a few choice things. I used ziploc bags to keep all this stuff organized, marking it with day of trip and location.

I managed to journal a few times once the roadtrip started, but it was not a realistic every day activity. I did most of it at home and I am not even done, Furkot, the organized ziplocs and the geolocation of the pictures helps a lot when sitting down to write. I did manage to journal quite a bit on the train though (before the roadtrip).

I stocked up on journaling and other supplies, some from home, some I ordered through Amazon to be picked up while East.

The list of things and its usefulness:

* Blank journals - filled one and a half, and I am not done writing yet!
* Colored fine liners
* Cannon Ivy mini photo printer: this was so good, I could pick 2-3 pictures for every day and print and stick on the journal, also could give them as souvenirs to family along the way
* Glue stick and scissors - I cut and pasted brochures, maps, scraps and text into the journal
* A sturdy bag to keep all the small stuff collected along the way and ziplocs

&amp;#x200B;

**Supplies**

* Physical version of a California Map - we used it very little as generally there was good coverage
* Ipad - we used it a little for navigation when the car's GPS didn't work, used it for music in the car, hotel bookings, reading and watching movies (we did very little of the two latter)

We stocked up at Walmarts, using some common sense and the tips provided by u/CarbonGod, u/bpsnoopy and u/Palindromer101 we had made a list and a budget of 150US, which we managed to keep. This is roughly what we got:

&amp;#x200B;

* Towels -never really needed them, but now I have two super fluffy towels
* Fleece throw - used it for sitting down on the ground
* Two small pillows - never really used them, we thought maybe if we needed to stay in the car
* Disposable plates, cutlery and cups - very useful for our many picnics
* A fanny pack/shoulder bag - I had a leather bag with me, but soon realized the strap was super uncomfortable, so this was great.
* Cooler and ice - a must, it was very easy to get ice anywhere, either at motels/hotels or stores
* Paper towels, wet wipes and tp - Super useful, the one item that was least used was the TP, we found well stocked and tidy bathrooms everywhere (except Yosemite Valley)
* A crate of water and drinks - This was super nice, we never had to buy any water, just open the back and get some ice-cold drinks.
* Food for picnics: bread, sauces, pickles, salad, fresh fruit, cheese, ham - We enjoyed so much stopping anywhere we felt like for a bite, and we saved a ton of money in food. We did have at least one meal a day at a restaurant.
* Road snacks - beef jerky, unhealthy delicious American stuff you cannot get here, energy bars...
* Personal care items: soap, shampoo, conditioner - always useful!
* First aid kit - we didn't have any issues, except my altitude sickness in Mammoth.
* Ziploc bags - This was very useful for keeping things dry in the cooler, but also for organizing all the brochures, stickers and crap I collected along the way. I marked each bag with dates and places, so when I sat down to journal it was very easy to figure out things.
* Trash bags - we strove to leave every place, in the same condition or better than we found it, so this was very very important. We carried the trash in the car until we found an appropriate place for disposal.
* Wine - We stocked up on wines where we could, so we could have a glass in the evenings. American supermarkets are weird, the variety of wines is not good. The best place we found was (in terms of price and variety) the Grocery Outlet in Mammoth, the cleaning lady at the hotel suggested it. We also visited many tasting rooms in Murphys!

Things that I didn't buy but wish I did:

* Laundry soap and softener/drier sheets - We ended up washing clothes several times and had to buy the expensive miniature stuff. I don't know why we didn't think of it.
* Headlight - would have been useful while walking in the dark, specially in Yosemite.

We stocked up every few days, we didn't need more ice every day.

**Meals**

In average, we ate ""out"" at least once everyday, we never opted out of ""too expensive"" if that is what we wanted to eat. We relied a lot on our supplies and picnics, we enjoyed it thoroughly, there are so many beautiful random places to stop along the way: Folsom Lake, Lake Tahoe shores, the banks of Stanislaus river in Calaveras, Columbia, Yosemite, June Lake....

We soon remembered about the size of portions in the US when we couldn't finish our meals and many times we shared one portion.

**Coffee**

This requires a special mention. We are not such big coffee drinkers, but the morning cup is a must.  It was hard to find good coffee in the hotels/motels. We kept a coffee diary too, for the most part it was awful, except at coffee shops. The little bags of coffee provided at the places we stayed to make on the coffee maker were truly horrible, not even using more quantity could we get some flavor out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Highlights**

* Most memorable meal: it is a tie between breakfast at the Getaway Cafe in Tahoe (the link is sadly expired, they do have a FB page though) and [Coppertop BBQ](https://www.coppertopbbq.com/) (thanks u/candres!!), special mention to the homemade Jalapeño poppers at the [Crazy Horse Saloon](http://crazyhorsenc.com/) in Nevada City - they were H O T!
* Best stays: there is also a competition here:

1. [Benton Hot Springs](https://www.bentonhotsprings.us/), looking at the stars in a ghost town in the desert, while soaking in a hot tub was magic!
2. Waking up in Yosemite Valley (we scored a ""Donald Duck"" tent, last minute in Curry Village)
3. [Murphys Historic Hotel](http://murphyshotel.com/), we loved it so much (the town and the hotel) we stayed an extra night. We met the hotel attendant, Bruce, a historian, who kindly took us on a tour of the old rooms, and told us the story of the hotel's ghost, Eleanor. We had dinner at the hotel and it was very good also, the service altogether was amazing. They were also the ONLY hotel to provide excellent coffee!!!

* Best unexpected detours: we had not planned for Murphys, and we loved it so much see above.
* Best sights: too many to count, sunset at Glacier Point was magical, Bodie was incredible (thanks u/candres, u/211logos, u/bpsnoopy and u/OchoC
* Best coffee: [Peet's coffee](https://www.peets.com/) in Yosemite by a LONG shot.
* Driving highlights (super fun!): Alabama Hills, Glacier Point after dark, Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, road to Bodie.
* Worst stay: Big Pines Mountain House in Tahoe. Fits the definition of a roach motel to a t. Dirty shits, dirty room, dingy everything. Utterly disgusting.
* Worst coffee: all of the coffee in the hotels, except Murphys.
* Worst meal: we had meals that were forgettable, but none that were bad.

Now onto planning some more, I will post for some suggestions soon!

roadtrip,"Hello! I am coming here in hopes of gaining some sort of blue print for a multi-month road trip of sorts. My current lease ends April 1st and being that I am working remotely, I am planning to travel (safely, of course) and be on the road with my dog. My though is to spend 2 weeks or so at a time stationed in a location and be able to explore on the weekends and after work hours. Since COVID is still very much a thing, I would prefer to be in the woods so state parks and national parks are most of interest to me as well as any other socially distanced activity I can do by myself (and with my dog). As for finding accommodations, I am not picky and just need places where I can have a solid internet connection M-F and that allows pets (he's emotional support but not a service animal). 

For further context, I will be starting out in the Philly area and was thinking of going south as I have family in Columbia, SC and haven't spent much time along the panhandle of Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, etc. I think Shenandoah and The Great Smokey Mtns are right up my alley, but again any input on where to stay would be appreciated as I don't need to be super close and am fine with being still a drive away.

I am only asking for suggestions so please leave any other comments/personal opinions regarding traveling during COVID to yourself.

I'm fairly new to the roadtrip game but I was hoping y'all could help a guy out! I'm planning a Utah roadtrip from Su 3/28 - Su 4/4. To maximize our time in each park, we've decided on the following tentative itinerary:

Th 4/1: Canyonlands NP

Fr 4/2: Capitol Reef NP

Sat 4/3: Capitol Reef/ back to Las Vegas, flying out 4/4

Does this sound like enough time per NP? Also a couple questions:

Zion:

\- Can someone PLEASE explain to me how the shuttle ticketing system works? Specifically, when the allotments come out - I'm so confused

\- We want to hit Zion earlier in the week Sunday evening, mon and tues; will is still be super crowded? For late march/early april, how early should we plan to arrive at the park?

\- we love to hike so any low key hike suggestions other than the big ones? (angels landing, subway, overlook, etc) We'd love ANY suggestions.

roadtrip,"Hi everyone,  
I [posted on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/grxuw7/trip_advice_wisconsincalifornia/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) during the planning stages for the trip, and got some great advice! I wanted to follow-up and share the actual details of the trip (which was GREAT). I'll share the stops we made, our impressions, and even some of the food we ate.

This was the actual route that we took:

[Route from Wisconsin to California](https://preview.redd.it/2185cs4bkcc61.png?width=2222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00805f9ecd3a5dbc0bf7339f9c759343d4247102)

This trip lasted 8 days total, and I will break down the stops we made along the way:

**Day 1: Wisconsin** → **Iowa** → **Nebraska**

* Madison WI: Half of the day was spent packing and moving out of an old apartment. Made an obligatory stop at Target for snacks.
* Overnight in Norfolk, NE

**Day 2: Nebraska** → **Wyoming (barely)** → **Colorado**

* Drove to [Carhenge](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2606): A super unique art installation - I definitely recommend!
* Drove through Cheyenne WY, and stopped at Rib &amp; Chop House for a delicious Steak.
* Drove  to Frisco, CO, where we stayed overnight. This was the longest driving day (around 12 hours total). There we managed to lock the keys in the rented car - big bummer! Ended up getting roadside assistance next morning.

&amp;#x200B;

[Carhenge](https://preview.redd.it/rlhqophqlfc61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b20c7fe38b5fca9510569741eaabcbacec55c902)

**Day 3: Colorado**

* As we waited for roadside assistance, we had a nice time in Frisco, CO - a super cute ski village. We had breakfast at a place called Bagalis, and walked around Main street.
* Once we were finally on our way, we stopped at [Twin Lakes](https://www.leadvilletwinlakes.com/natural-attractions-detail/twin-lakes/) for a nice view.
* We then drove up a treacherous road to [Maroon Bells](https://www.colorado.com/articles/explore-maroon-bells-what-you-need-know), which was one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited. Since we got there in the afternoon, and we didn't have time for a very long hike. We still did the Crater Lake Trail (3.6 miles roundtrip). It was incredible! 
* The drive up and down the mountain (from Maroon Bells) was kind of scary at times, especially in a large car. I wouldn't recommend driving there at night.
* After hiking, we drove past Aspen, CO, and decided to look for food there. Everything was pretty snooty and overpriced...(I guess we should have expected it from Aspen)
* Finally, we ended the day in Fruita, CO.

&amp;#x200B;

[Maroon Bells](https://preview.redd.it/p9f7s0atlfc61.jpg?width=1898&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf759244df1ee550628ddb79d74d26d261bdd9db)

**Day 4: Colorado** → **Utah**

* As a last minute change-of-plans, we decided to drive through the [Colorado National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/colm/index.htm). Great decision! It was a great road with beautiful overlook stops.
* We drove to Moab, Utah and had lunch at Arches Thai (delicious).
* We then went to Arches National Park, and decided to go see the [Delicate Arch](https://www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/delicate-arch.htm). It was amazing! We sat there for a while and enjoyed the view. Arches NP was so great, we decided to stay nearby and hike there again the next day.
* We had dinner at Moab diner

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 5: Utah**

* We couldn't miss out on seeing a few more arches, so we went to the [Landscape arch](https://utah.com/hiking/arches-national-park/landscape-arch-trail), and the proceeded to get lost somewhere on the way to the Double arch, but ended up finding our way back on the [primitive trail](https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/parks-outdoors/arches/adventure-guide/arches-devils-garden-primitive-loop) (around 6-8 miles total). It felt like we were in a sci-fi movie! Incredible views - I've never seen anything quite like it before.
* We then drove in the direction of Zion National Park

&amp;#x200B;

[Arches National Park: Delicate Arch](https://preview.redd.it/eu46i2j9mfc61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d15312f2d891a06041851dd6565632dd9cbf101)

**Day 6: Utah → Nevada**

* We woke up very early, and decided to go attempt the famous [Angels Landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy6K0KoMrco&amp;t=47s) hike. I have to admit that I was VERY nervous, even before being near it...Unfortunately (or luckily?), the ""chains"" part of the hike was closed due to COVID-19 (there was an actual park ranger assigned to keep hikers away). We still hiked up from the Grotto trailhead to Angels Landing, and even continued towards west rim spring. Even though we couldn't do the final part of Angels Landing, the views were unbelievable, and we didn't have to fear for our lives.
* After the exhausting hike, we had a nice cold beer at the Zion Canyon Brew Pub.
* We left Zion NP, and drove to Las Vegas, NV.
* That night we walked around on the strip for a bit, but it was way too crowded, and our legs felt like they might fall off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 7: Nevada → California**

* We had breakfast at Bagelmania in Las Vegas - a pretty cute bagel spot.
* We drove to Death Valley, and made a few stops at [Rhyolite](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rhyolite-ghost-town) ghost town. This is a spooky abandoned town, which also sets the stage for really cool art installations. If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend to check it out.
* The heat was unbearable! We left the car for no longer than 10 minutes at a time, and turned really cranky really quickly. In other words, we mostly enjoyed Death Valley from the comfort of our car. 
*  We ended the day in Delano, CA.

**Day 8: San Francisco**

* The last day was just about reaching our final destination - SAN FRANCISCO.
* We had dinner at [Limon Rotisserie](https://www.limonrotisserie.com/) in the Mission - it was so good!

**Reflections**

* Great podcasts we listened to on the way: 'Stuff You Should Know', 'Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend', '99% Invisible', and more. Download music + podcasts for longer drives - you may lose service.
* Make sure you always grab the keys before shutting the car door!!!
* Try to check in advance if certain destinations require a reservation / have an entry fee. Colorado National monument had a fee, and Zion requires shuttle tickets to get around (no entry for cars in the summer). I also believe we were only allowed to enter Maroon Bells after a certain time without a reservation (after 5/6pm). All of our plans worked out very well - but I think we were very lucky.
* There was a long stretch (probably 100+ miles) in Nebraska with no service. We were scared that we might run out of gas...Make sure to plan for long drives through rural areas.
* Just an observation: At every gas station / road stop in Iowa and Nebraska, the vast majority of people were NOT wearing a mask. But as soon as we entered Colorado, everyone seemed very cautious. I'm sure this also has to do with the specific rural vs. urban areas we passed..
* My favorite places: Arches NP, Maroon Bells

Thank you for checking out my long long post :-)",Awesome Wisconsin → California 8 Day Road Trip,"Hi everyone,  
I [posted on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/grxuw7/trip_advice_wisconsincalifornia/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) during the planning stages for the trip, and got some great advice! I wanted to follow-up and share the actual details of the trip (which was GREAT). I'll share the stops we made, our impressions, and even some of the food we ate.

This was the actual route that we took:

[Route from Wisconsin to California](https://preview.redd.it/2185cs4bkcc61.png?width=2222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00805f9ecd3a5dbc0bf7339f9c759343d4247102)

This trip lasted 8 days total, and I will break down the stops we made along the way:

**Day 1: Wisconsin** → **Iowa** → **Nebraska**

* Madison WI: Half of the day was spent packing and moving out of an old apartment. Made an obligatory stop at Target for snacks.
* Overnight in Norfolk, NE

**Day 2: Nebraska** → **Wyoming (barely)** → **Colorado**

* Drove to [Carhenge](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2606): A super unique art installation - I definitely recommend!
* Drove through Cheyenne WY, and stopped at Rib &amp; Chop House for a delicious Steak.
* Drove  to Frisco, CO, where we stayed overnight. This was the longest driving day (around 12 hours total). There we managed to lock the keys in the rented car - big bummer! Ended up getting roadside assistance next morning.

&amp;#x200B;

[Carhenge](https://preview.redd.it/rlhqophqlfc61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b20c7fe38b5fca9510569741eaabcbacec55c902)

**Day 3: Colorado**

* As we waited for roadside assistance, we had a nice time in Frisco, CO - a super cute ski village. We had breakfast at a place called Bagalis, and walked around Main street.
* Once we were finally on our way, we stopped at [Twin Lakes](https://www.leadvilletwinlakes.com/natural-attractions-detail/twin-lakes/) for a nice view.
* We then drove up a treacherous road to [Maroon Bells](https://www.colorado.com/articles/explore-maroon-bells-what-you-need-know), which was one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited. Since we got there in the afternoon, and we didn't have time for a very long hike. We still did the Crater Lake Trail (3.6 miles roundtrip). It was incredible! 
* The drive up and down the mountain (from Maroon Bells) was kind of scary at times, especially in a large car. I wouldn't recommend driving there at night.
* After hiking, we drove past Aspen, CO, and decided to look for food there. Everything was pretty snooty and overpriced...(I guess we should have expected it from Aspen)
* Finally, we ended the day in Fruita, CO.

&amp;#x200B;

[Maroon Bells](https://preview.redd.it/p9f7s0atlfc61.jpg?width=1898&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf759244df1ee550628ddb79d74d26d261bdd9db)

**Day 4: Colorado** → **Utah**

* As a last minute change-of-plans, we decided to drive through the [Colorado National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/colm/index.htm). Great decision! It was a great road with beautiful overlook stops.
* We drove to Moab, Utah and had lunch at Arches Thai (delicious).
* We then went to Arches National Park, and decided to go see the [Delicate Arch](https://www.nps.gov/arch/planyourvisit/delicate-arch.htm). It was amazing! We sat there for a while and enjoyed the view. Arches NP was so great, we decided to stay nearby and hike there again the next day.
* We had dinner at Moab diner

&amp;#x200B;

**Day 5: Utah**

* We couldn't miss out on seeing a few more arches, so we went to the [Landscape arch](https://utah.com/hiking/arches-national-park/landscape-arch-trail), and the proceeded to get lost somewhere on the way to the Double arch, but ended up finding our way back on the [primitive trail](https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/parks-outdoors/arches/adventure-guide/arches-devils-garden-primitive-loop) (around 6-8 miles total). It felt like we were in a sci-fi movie! Incredible views - I've never seen anything quite like it before.
* We then drove in the direction of Zion National Park

&amp;#x200B;

[Arches National Park: Delicate Arch](https://preview.redd.it/eu46i2j9mfc61.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d15312f2d891a06041851dd6565632dd9cbf101)

**Day 6: Utah → Nevada**

* We woke up very early, and decided to go attempt the famous [Angels Landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy6K0KoMrco&amp;t=47s) hike. I have to admit that I was VERY nervous, even before being near it...Unfortunately (or luckily?), the ""chains"" part of the hike was closed due to COVID-19 (there was an actual park ranger assigned to keep hikers away). We still hiked up from the Grotto trailhead to Angels Landing, and even continued towards west rim spring. Even though we couldn't do the final part of Angels Landing, the views were unbelievable, and we didn't have to fear for our lives.
* After the exhausting hike, we had a nice cold beer at the Zion Canyon Brew Pub.
* We left Zion NP, and drove to Las Vegas, NV.
* That night we walked around on the strip for a bit, but it was way too crowded, and our legs felt like they might fall off.

&amp;#x200B;

roadtrip,"I just started planning a semi last minute road trip for me and the gf and I have the basics in place. I just know there are so many hidden gems out there and I’d love some insight, googling will only get you so far. Here’s what I got:

Fly into Vegas on Friday, pick up rented campervan Saturday morning and drive straight to Zion. 2 nights near Zion.

Plan to leave Zion on Monday morning and drive to Bryce for some light hiking and for sunset. Spend the night near here, catch the sunrise and leave.

Tuesday morning take Highway 12 to Capitol Reef (I’m a sucker for a scenic drive but putting this drive into my loop has been a pain) spend the night near here.

And this is where I really need help, my first thought was to take the 95 down into monument valley and then over to Page, AZ but this seems like a lot of driving for not much to do. My other option is to take highway 24 west, which ultimately will take me to interstate 15, which takes me back to Vegas.

There’s lots of different things we would like to see in a short period of time. I have somewhat of an idea in mind but needing to know if it’s realistic. 

May 26th- All day driving from St. Louis to Alamosa, CO to get ready to go to the Great Sand Dunes National Park.
May 27th- Spend all day at the Sand Dunes National Park, camp close by if weather permits 
May 28th- Drive to Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, maybe explore Colorado Spring if time allows and then drive to Denver that night 
May 29th- Explore Denver all day
May 30th- Drive to Rocky Mountain National Park, stay all day
May 31st- Another day at the Rocky Mountain National Park
June 1st- All day driving back home

Is this doable or too overwhelming? Also any tips about the weather around this time and if camping would be a good idea?

roadtrip,"My boyfriend and I want to take a road trip out west this summer, taking my minivan and putting a mattress in it or tent camping. Neither of us have been out west, so I am open to suggestions on where we should visit!! So far I have this: 

Parks we want to go to- Grand Teton, Glacier, Yellowstone, Olympic, Mount Rainier

We would start in Madison, WI and head west. I would like to see national parks in Oregon and Washington, along with the ones listed above. Also hoping to visit Colorado as well.

roadtrip,"National Parks are already on the list of ""must see"" places.

We are a 40ish couple from New England looking to explore some western states... eventually. Right now we are looking at Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. Odds are we will plan our trip for late summer - early autumn, we are thinking it'll last about a month. I am looking for planning input.


Things we may be interested hearing about in include:

Local history - what can I learn about before our adventure and places to see in person

Interesting cemeteries- I enjoy learning about an area from looking at older/unique markers.

Scenic routes - that wont destroy our vehicle or get us stuck - likely not high clearance or 4wd

Hiking - nothing technical, dayhikes/10 miles (less with a lot of elevation). We like summits, waterfalls and natural beauty 

Smaller campgrounds - with showers is a huge plus!

Road food - diner type, breakfast all day, mom &amp; pop places - no chain or fast food

Anything we should know ahead of time - hazards/risks, weather (in Aug/Sept), places to avoid, laws or cultural norms we should be aware of...","Planning help needed. ID, MT, WY, CO, UT","National Parks are already on the list of ""must see"" places.
