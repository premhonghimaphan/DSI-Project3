## Project 3: Web APIs & Classification (Reddit)
## Problem Statement
Its been a long time since people can actually travel freely. This serves as a perfect opportunity for travel companies to build new products that provide a niche in the market. Especially after the world opens again, travel industry would probably sky rocket and everyone would offer the nicest deals they can.

One of the niche identified by this travel agency is the opportunity to create product/service for solotraveler and people who would like to go on road trips, focusing on United States. In order to exploit this particular niche, the manager has asked a market research firm to conduct preliminary analysis on solo traveling and road trips.

In order to find out what people talk about in regards to travel, we will look to analyze posts on Reddit. Reddit is a great platform for discussion, especially in the United States. More than just random posts on Reddit, they also have subreddits that people can go to in order to find content or start a discussion that people in the same group like talking about.

Based on my findings of what people talk about on Reddit, the company would then like to build their product/services with features that people often discuss about on Reddit and offer lucrative packages.

## Why Reddit for information about USA?
According to Statista, regional distribution of desktop traffic to Reddit.com as of December 2020, by country, shows that USA has traffic of around 50%.
